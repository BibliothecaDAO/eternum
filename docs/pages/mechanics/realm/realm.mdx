# Realms

Originally created as "Realms (For Adventurers)", they were the first Loot derivative, comprising 8,000 generative maps
with unique metadata of resources and traits.

## Realm Access

- Each Realm NFT grants entry into Eternum seasons
- Owners become Lords of their onchain kingdoms
- Access to specific resources from the 22 available types

## Starting Values

### 💎 **Starting resources**

Quests have been prepared to help you learn the ropes as a newly appointed Lord of your Realm. Going through these will
help you learn the game and reward you with starting resources. Claim your resources when you complete each quest.

## Settlement Immunity

When first settling a realm, you receive:

- <span>
    {(EternumGlobalConfig.tick.armiesTickIntervalInSeconds / 3600) * EternumGlobalConfig.battle.graceTickCount} hour
    immunity from attacks and from attacking others
  </span>

- Protection from resource raids
- Time to establish basic defenses

## Realm Levels

As your realm grows, you will need more buildable space to expand. Upgrading your realms from a settlement to an empire
requires various resources. The costs of upgrading your realms are as follows:

### Realm Upgrade Costs

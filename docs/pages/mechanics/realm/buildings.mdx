# Buildings

Buildings are essential structures in your realm that provide various benefits. Each construction increases the cost of
subsequent buildings of the same type exponentially.

## Building Types

### Basic Infrastructure

<BuildingCard
  title="Worker Hut"
  image="/buildings/workers_hut.png"
  buildingType={BuildingType.WorkersHut}
  description={["Basic population housing", "Provides population capacity"]}
/>

<BuildingCard
  title="Storehouse"
  image="/buildings/storehouse.png"
  buildingType={BuildingType.Storehouse}
  description={[
    "Increases resource storage capacity",
    "Essential for resource management",
    "Prevents production waste",
    "Consider building more when storage is frequently full",
  ]}
/>

### Production Buildings

<BuildingCard
  title="Farm"
  image="/buildings/farm.png"
  buildingType={BuildingType.Farm}
  description={[
    "Produces Wheat",
    "No input resources required",
    "Provides 10% production bonus to adjacent buildings",
    "Strategic placement is key for optimization",
  ]}
/>

<BuildingCard
  title="Fishing Village"
  image="/buildings/fishing_village.png"
  buildingType={BuildingType.FishingVillage}
  description={["Produces Fish", "No input resources required"]}
/>

<BuildingCard
  title="Market"
  image="/buildings/market.png"
  buildingType={BuildingType.Market}
  description={["Produces Donkeys", "Consumes $LORDS", "Essential for trading"]}
/>

<BuildingCard
  title="Resource Facility"
  multipleImages={true}
  image={[
    { src: "/buildings/forge.png", alt: "Forge" },
    { src: "/buildings/mine.png", alt: "Mine" },
    { src: "/buildings/lumber_mill.png", alt: "Lumber Mill" },
  ]}
  buildingType={BuildingType.Resource}
  description={["Produces specified resource", "Consumes other resources"]}
/>

### Military Buildings

<BuildingCard
  title="Barracks"
  image="/buildings/barracks.png"
  buildingType={BuildingType.Barracks}
  description={["Produces Knights", "Increases max army count by 1"]}
/>

<BuildingCard
  title="Stables"
  image="/buildings/stable.png"
  buildingType={BuildingType.Stable}
  description={[
    "Produces Paladins",
    "Increases max army count by 1",
    "Requires higher resource investment than Barracks",
  ]}
/>

<BuildingCard
  title="Archery Range"
  image="/buildings/archery.png"
  buildingType={BuildingType.ArcheryRange}
  description={["Produces Crossbowmen", "Increases max army count by 1", "Provides ranged combat capabilities"]}

/>

### Production Management

‚öôÔ∏è **Production Controls**

Buildings can be paused/resumed: Pausing stops:

- Resource consumption
- Resource production

Use pausing to:

- Prevent resource waste
- Manage storage capacity

### Construction Management

üí° **Cost Scaling**

Each subsequent building costs double:

- First building: Base cost
- Second building: 2x base cost
- Third building: 4x base cost

üß± **Building Tips**

- Prioritize buildings based on your realm's needs
- Consider population increase and capacity
- Monitor resource production and storage capacity

# Key Concepts

## ⏳ Time Cycle

Everything in the Eternum revolves around an Eternum Day. Each Eternum Day is 60 minutes long. The hourglass timer
displays the percentage of the day that has passed.

## 🌎 World Map

Explore the Eternum World Map to search for realms, significant structures, and strategize battles. Armies can traverse
through hexes that have already been discovered or venture into unexplored ones. Their stamina is partially replenished
each Eternum Day.

## 💎 Resource Production

Resources are produced by buildings in a realm. Most production chains require input resources to generate output
resources.

Maintaining a balanced production is key to sustaining your realm's economy. If there are insufficient resources or
storage capacity, production automatically stops, but input resources continue to be consumed until paused.

## 🤝 Trading

Trading is the backbone of the economy in Eternum. The Lords Market is a central marketplace where players can buy and
sell resources to each other.

Trades are facilitated via donkeys and the cost depends on the weight of the resources being transported. Donkeys are
required for all trades.

## 🏛️ Hyperstructures

Hyperstructures are the key to ruling Eternum. Build and contribute to them and earn valuable Victory Points (VP).
Victory in Eternum is achieved a player accumulating **{formatNumberWithCommas(HYPERSTRUCTURE_POINTS_FOR_WIN)}** Victory
Points and ending the season.

Hyperstructures are built using Ancient Fragments that can only be obtained through Fragment Mines scattered around the
map.

Once a player reaches the required seasons VP they will be able to end the season and claim victory!

## 👥 Tribes

Tribes are player-formed social organizations in Eternum that enable cooperation and coordination. Anyone can join
public tribes. Private tribes are by invitation-only.

### Winning Conditions

Victory in Eternum is achieved by accumulating **{formatNumberWithCommas(HYPERSTRUCTURE_POINTS_FOR_WIN)}** points. While
points can only be earned through Hyperstructures, success requires various strategic activities:

- Trading resources to fund Hyperstructure construction
- Raiding realms to acquire resources
- Building and contributing to Hyperstructures

Any player who accumulates the required number of points can call the END_GAME contract, which disables all further game
actions. At this point:

- All points are calculated and finalized
- Any remaining resources or Lords tokens within the game must be bridged out **UP TO 48 hours** from this point until
  they become permanently inaccessible

### Season Rewards

The individual rewards system is based on Victory Points (VP). Any player who earns VP during the season is eligible for
rewards. The payout is directly proportional to the percentage of total VP earned:

- If you earned 5% of all VP during the season, you receive 5% of the individual prize pool
- All VP-earning players receive rewards, regardless of ranking
- Rewards are calculated using: `(Your VP / Total VP) * Prize Pool`

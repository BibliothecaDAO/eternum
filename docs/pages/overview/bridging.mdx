# Bridge Closure

<Callout type="danger">
  # Critical End-Game Information The Game Bridge **permanently** closes **48 hours** after after victory has been
  claimed. [Read the full End Season Disclaimer](/overview/disclaimer) to understand all risks and limitations.

## Bridging in Eternum

Eternum is a fully onchain game with immutable smart contracts, meaning the game rules cannot be altered. Bridging
tokens in and out of the game is a core mechanic, but you must carefully manage this process.

<Callout type="warning">
  ### End Game Bridge Closure - The game bridge closes **permanently** 48 hours after "End Season" is triggered - Only
  resources in your Realm's direct balance can be bridged out - Resources in the following locations are NOT part of
  your bridgeable balance: - AMM Liquidity Pool positions - Open market orders - Resources in transit - Any resources
  not bridged out by the deadline are **permanently locked** in the contract
</Callout>

## Bridging in

This is the only way to bridge in Lords to the game. This converts ERC20 Lords into in-game Lords. Only in-game Lords
can be used to build and trade with.

### Initial Bridge

You need to first initialize the transfer.

### Final Bridge (Within Game Client)

Once you finish the first step, the Lords/resources will appear in your inventory to be used in the game.

## Bridging out

You can bridge out resources from the game, which will be converted to the ERC20 contracts.

### Step 1: Start the bridge

### Step 2: Finalize the bridge

### Game End

When "End Season" is triggered:

1. A **48-hour countdown** begins immediately
2. During this window, you can only:
   - Bridge out **$LORDS** and resources from your Realm's direct balance
   - Register your score (within 4 days)

To preserve your assets, you **must**:

> 1. Remove all liquidity from AMM pools **before** the season ends
> 2. Cancel all open orders on the Order Book **before** the season ends
> 3. Ensure all resource transfers to your Realm are completed **before** the season ends
> 4. Bridge out **$LORDS** and **Resources** from your Realm's balance within the 48-hour window

<Callout type="error">
  ### ⚠️ Permanent Loss Warning ⚠️ - The 48-hour countdown is **final** and **cannot be extended** - Developers
  **cannot** recover any assets after the bridge closes - Any resources not in your Realm's direct balance **cannot** be
  bridged out - Plan ahead to ensure all your assets are in your Realm's balance before the season ends

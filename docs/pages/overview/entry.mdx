# Game Entry & Participation

## Season Access

### Realm Holder Entry <img src="/ring_pass.png" alt="Season entry" width="300" className=" float-right" />

Realm holders enjoy exclusive benefits, including free entry into each new Season. Each Season Pass is unique to a Realm
and grants access to the game. To use a season pass for game entry, players must transfer it to their Cartridge Wallet.

- Mint your pass [here](https://empire.realms.world/)

### Non-Realm Holder Entry

#### Marketplace

Should a Realm holder decide not to play with their Season Pass, they can transfer it or sell it on the
[Realms Marketplace](https://market.realms.world/) allowing non-Realm holders to participate in the game.

#### Synthetic Realms

> ⚠️ **Coming Soon**
>
> Synthetic Realms will be introduced in future seasons.
>
> **This feature will not be available during Season 0**.

During gameplay, Realm holders will have the opportunity to discover Synthetic Realms. These discovered Realms can then
be auctioned using **$LORDS**, allowing non-Realm holders to participate in the game through temporary ownership for the
current Season. Auction fees will be distributed through the game fee system.

### Continuous Play

As long as you maintain in-game Realm ownership, you can actively participate without additional entry fees. Engage in
the market using **$LORDS** tokens and enjoy uninterrupted gameplay.

### Realm Control Mechanics

⚔️ **Takeover System**

In-game Realms can be conquered within a Season, transferring control to the conqueror. Gameplay rights are restored at
the start of the next Season, ensuring a dynamic and competitive environment.

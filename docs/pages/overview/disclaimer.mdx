## Immutable Contracts

Eternum is governed entirely by **immutable** smart contracts. Once deployed, the game’s rules and mechanics **cannot be
altered, updated, or reversed** by the developers, the DAO, or any other party. These smart contracts have **not** been
audited. Players should fully understand the implications of interacting with the system and assess the risks involved.

## Risk of Loss

All transactions and gameplay actions in Eternum are **final**. There are no mechanisms for refunds, reversals, or
compensation. You acknowledge the **risk of loss of funds** and accept that you bear sole responsibility for any
financial impact incurred.

A season of Eternum concludes when a single player achieves the required
**{formatNumberWithSpaces(HYPERSTRUCTURE_POINTS_FOR_WIN)}** Victory Points and clicks the "End Season" button. At this
point:

- A **48 hour** period begins where you **must** bridge out **ALL $LORDS** tokens and in-game resources.
- After this period, **ALL $LORDS** tokens and **Resources** are **permanently** locked within the game.
- Individual rewards are claimed by **registering** scores. Players will have **4 days** to register their scores and
  **must** register to be eligible. There is **no** time limit to claim prizes.

Players are encouraged to review the documentation for instructions on how to bridge tokens out during the active
gameplay phase.

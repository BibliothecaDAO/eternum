# Realistic NPC Expansion

**Realistic NPC Expansion** is a Realms-Eternum extension designed to inject new life into the virtual world. It generates NPCs with attributes and leverages the OpenAI API to foster dynamic and imaginative interactions with these characters, creating a sense of progression and growth in the virtual world.

## Introduction

This project, born during the Dojo Game Jam #2, brings fresh, interactive content to the virtual world. With a focus on generating diverse NPCs and enabling engaging dialogues, it aims to make your realm more immersive and exciting.

## How-to

Add the openAI api key to the .env file in the VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY variable. We will DM you one on request for local demoing

## Team

Our project benefits from a globally diverse team, with members currently living in three different countries. We believe that this geographical diversity enriches our perspective and allows us to bring a variety of skills and experiences to the table.

Despite the geographical distances, we collaborate seamlessly, leveraging our collective expertise in software development, design, and project management to bring our vision to life.

            <p>
              Eternum is governed entirely by <strong>immutable</strong> smart contracts. Once deployed, the game's
              rules and mechanics <strong>cannot be altered, updated, or reversed</strong> by the developers, the DAO,
              or any other party.

              compensation. You acknowledge the <strong>risk of loss of funds</strong> and accept that you bear sole
              responsibility for any financial impact incurred.

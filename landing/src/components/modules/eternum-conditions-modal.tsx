          You bridge tokens in and out of the game. The game bridge is closed forever 48 hours after the game ends. Any
          tokens left in the game at that time are permanently locked in the contract (aka burned).

        <TypeP>
          Bridging out of the game is done by sending resources to a bank.{" "}
          <strong>That takes time and requires donkeys.</strong> It's part of the game - with immutable contracts code
          is law. Plan around it, it is your responsibility to bridge out and the developers cannot do anything to
          change the code after deployment.

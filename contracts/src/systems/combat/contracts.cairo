    ///     and health.
    ///     - Uses a probabilistic model to determine if the pillaging attempt is successful.
    ///     - Randomly selects resources from the structure to pillage, considering army capacity
    ///     and resource availability.
    /// 4. **Outcome Effects**:
    ///     - If the pillage attempt is successful, transfers resources from the structure to the
    ///     attacking army.
    ///     - Optionally destroys a building within the structure based on specific conditions.

⚔️ Realms: Blitz Official Game Guide

Blitz is a real-time strategy variant of Eternum designed for rapid, competitive play. In each 90-minute match, players
strategically manage resources, explore territories, and engage in high-intensity military confrontations.

Blitz's streamlined mechanics and accelerated gameplay require swift decision-making and adaptability, resulting in a
high skill ceiling that rewards skill and experience.

Recruit Bracket:** No-stakes; for new players to learn. Gladiator Bracket:_ Competitions for _$LORDS** token stakes.
Warrior Bracket:* The core of a Blitz 'series'—success brings Loot Chest rewards and invitations to the *Elite
bracket\*\*.

📜 Rule Summary

Game Duration Each Blitz game runs for exactly 90 minutes. Time is measured in Eternum Days (6 minutes long), divided
into six 'phases'.

Realms Three Starting Realms:** Evenly spaced in a triangle formation. Equal Capability:** All Realms are functionally
identical at the start. Free Building:** Construct any resource building (restricted only by space/population). Conquest
Mechanics:** Realms can be captured. Deployed armies become the conqueror's property; stored troops are destroyed.
Exclusions:\*\* No Wonders or Village systems.

Materials Resources (9):** Wood, Coal, Copper, Ironwood, Cold Iron, Gold, Adamantine, Mithril, Dragonhide. Food (1):**
Wheat. Essence:** Found by exploring/structures; required for upgrades. Labor:** Produced by the Realm; required for
construction. Donkeys:** Essential for logistics; cost only food to produce. Troops:** 3 types (Knights, Crossbowmen,
Paladins) across 3 tiers. Restrictions:\*\* No P2P transfers. Only Relics can be bridged in (WIP).

Buildings The Keep:** Central structure (automatic). Types:** Resource, Economic (Farms, Markets), Military. Modes:\*\*
"Resource mode" vs "Labor mode" construction.

Production Accelerated Rates:** All production is increased for the fast-paced format. Inputs:** Resources require other
resources or labor. Troops require lower-tier troops as inputs. Donkeys are one-time use.

World Map & Military Exploration:** Reveal hexes to find Essence, Hyperstructures, and enemies. Biomes:** 16 unique
types affecting combat (+/- 30% damage) and movement. Stamina:_ Armies recover _+20 stamina per Phase** (+120 per Day).
Army Types:** Field Armies: Map exploration and conquest. Guard Armies: Static defense of structures.

Victory Leaderboard ranking is determined by Victory Points (VP) awarded for exploring, claiming structures, opening
Relic Crates, and holding Hyperstructures. The highest VP count shares the $LORDS prize pool.

⚖️ The Code is Law In Blitz, every action is governed by onchain physics—immutable rules encoded directly onto the
blockchain, ensuring fairness, transparency, and absolute consistency for all Lords. Code is law; no exceptions exist
outside these protocols.

⏳ Time & Duration

Total Duration:** 90 Minutes. Eternum Day:** 6 Minutes. Phases:** 6 per day (1 minute each). Total Days:* A single game
spans *15 Eternum Days**.

📦 Materials & Economy

Note: "Materials" refers to all tangible assets (Food, Resources, Essence, Labor, Troops, Donkeys). "Resources"
specifically refers to the 9 mined materials.

Cost of Production With the exception of food and labor, nothing is free. Every unit of production demands an input.
Lords must balance costs to maximize their score within the 90-minute window.

Travel & Logistics Donkeys:* Required for *every* transfer of materials. They are *single-use** and consumed upon
arrival. Troop Movement:** Inventory: Moved via Donkeys (cannot fight). Deployed: Moved via Stamina on the map (cannot
return to inventory).

Biomes Each hex has a distinct biome affecting troop efficiency. Types:\*\* Bare, Beach, Deep Ocean, Grassland, Ocean,
Scorched, Shrubland, Snow, Subtropical Desert, Taiga, Temperate Desert, Deciduous Forest, Temperate Rainforest, Tropical
Rainforest, Tropical Seasonal Forest, Tundra.

🏰 Realms

Players start with three Realms in a triangular formation. These are not related to the 8,000 Realm NFTs of Eternum.

Settling & Spawns Registration:** Required before start. Settling:** Must be done immediately at game start to secure
the randomized spawn position. Map Layout:\*\* A single Hyperstructure marks the center. Concentric rings of
Hyperstructures spawn every 15 hexes. Player positions rotate to ensure equal access. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: There is no immunity
period. Realms can be attacked immediately.

⚔️ Military & Armies

Army Composition Max Size:** 30,000 units. Type:** Single troop type and tier per army. Limit:\*\* Max 10 Field Armies
per structure (gained via Military Buildings).

Field Armies Used for exploration, claiming Hyperstructures, and attacking. Deployed on the 6 hexes surrounding the
Realm. Can only merge with armies from the same structure.

Guard Armies Static defense located in specific slots. Resurrection:* If destroyed, the slot is unavailable for *10
minutes\*\*.

| Structure      | Guard Slots |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Camp           | 1           |
| Essence Rift   | 1           |

🗺️ The World Map

Exploration The world is hidden in mist. Exploring a hex permanently reveals its biome and structures to all Lords.

Hyperstructure Positioning Algorithm Rings ($r$):** $\sqrt{P/6}$ (Where $P$ is players). Hyperstructures per ring
($H$):** $6r$.

Relic Crates Randomly appear near explored tiles. Reward:** 3 Relics + 1,000 Victory Points. Effect:** Relics boost
production, stamina regen, or combat damage.

🏗️ World Structures

All structures start occupied by Bandits (800–1,600 troops) and must be defeated to claim.

1. Hyperstructures Fully constructed at game start. Generate VP based on the number of nearby player Realms (within 8
   tiles). Capturing yields immediate VP; holding yields VP/sec.

2. Essence Rifts Provide Essence (required for upgrades/high-tier troops). Rate:** 10 units/sec (Max 72,000 units/game).
   Rarity:** 1/50 chance per hex.

3. Camps Act as forward bases (Settlement level, cannot upgrade). Rarity:** 1/30 chance per hex. Starting Loot:** 500
   Wheat, 2,500 Labor, 200 Donkeys.

👑 Victory & Scoring

The goal is to accumulate Victory Points (VP).

# Current Priorities

1. **Exploration** (HIGH) — Each explored tile awards Victory Points
2. **Economy** (HIGH) — Resource production enables all other activities
3. **Military** (LOW) — No known threats yet
4. **Expansion** (LOW) — Requires scouting data first

## Victory Points (VP) — How Scoring Works

Leaderboard rank is determined by total accumulated VP. VP is awarded for:

| Source | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Exploring tiles | One-time per tile | Every new hex discovered awards VP |
| Claiming World Structures (Essence Rifts, Camps) | One-time | Only awarded on first capture from bandit forces |
| Opening Relic Crates | One-time | Found during exploration |
| Claiming Hyperstructures | One-time | Only awarded on first capture from bandit forces |
| Holding Hyperstructures | **Ongoing** | **Accumulates VP per cycle for as long as you hold it** |

**Key facts:**
- VP from claiming structures/hyperstructures is only awarded the **first time** they are captured from bandits — recapturing from other players does not award claim VP
- Hyperstructures in Blitz are **pre-built** and positioned on the map at game start — no construction needed, just defeat the bandit guards to claim
- Holding hyperstructures is the only **ongoing** VP source — all others are one-time awards

## World Structures

| Type | What It Provides |
|------|-----------------|
| Essence Rift (Fragment Mine) | Produces Essence (1/tick) — required for T2/T3 troops |
| Camp | Capturable structure |
| Hyperstructure | **Ongoing VP accumulation** while held — the primary scoring engine |

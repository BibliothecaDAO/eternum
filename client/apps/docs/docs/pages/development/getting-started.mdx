# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [Dojo onchain game engine](https://book.dojoengine.org)
- React

## Setup

Install dojo via

`curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash`

Make sure install the same version within the `Scarb.toml` file.

Eternum uses a pnpm workspace and bun for scripts to allow easy npm packages to be created. So you will need pnpm
installed also.

`npm install -g pnpm`

## Easy Method (3 commands)

We have bundled up three scripts to run in three different CLI terminals. Run the scripts in order and leave the window
open.

### Terminal 1 - Client setup

This will set the client up, however you **must** run the other scripts otherwise it will not work

```
sh scripts/client.sh
```

### Terminal 2 - Build the contracts and run the sequencer

```
sh scripts/contracts.sh
```

### Terminal 3 - Migrate the contracts and start the indexer

```
<!-- to set config -->
sh scripts/indexer.sh --setConfig

<!-- to just build and index -->
sh scripts/indexer.sh
```

# Environment Variables

For local development, create a file called `.env.local` in the client repository and add the following:

```bash

# Stack

- [Contracts](/development/contracts): built using the Dojo framework. This leverages the ECS model, allowing us to
  build quick and ship fast. It revolves around 3 units: Entities, Components (called Models in Dojo) and Systems (more
  about this in the Dojo book).
- [Client](/development/client): our client is built using React with Typescript. We leverage Dojo by using DojoJS
- [Eternum SDK](/development/sdk): our SDK contains most notably the getter and setter of the configuration of Eternum,
  the EternumProvider and most of the constants/types of the world that needed to be transcribed to Typescript.
- [Torii](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/torii): Dojo's indexer, optimized for that particular framework and well
  integrated into the stack. From our client, we have a gRPC subscription set up through DojoJS and recs to events.
  Events are fired in the contracts as a way for the indexer to know what's going on in the world. Every time an entity
  is created, updated, or deleted, an event is fired which updated Torii's record of the world.
- [DojoJS and recs](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo.js?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing-to-dojojs): DojoJS is the SDK
  that allows easy integration of a Dojo app into your client/node backend. Recs are DojoJS's way of exposing the state
  of the world to the client. This is done via queries to the Recs state using a simple query language, which doesn't
  support complex queries yet (e.g. joins, gt, lt, etc...).

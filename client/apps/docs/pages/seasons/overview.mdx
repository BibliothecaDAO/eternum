# Seasons

Eternum utilizes a seasonal system to maintain a fresh and exciting metagame, leveraging its unique two-layer
architecture to enable dynamic gameplay experiences.

## Overview

Seasons in Eternum are distinct gameplay periods that operate under specific rules and logic while maintaining certain
persistent elements (such as resources) across different seasons.

This system allows for regular refreshes of the game meta and introduction of new mechanics without completely resetting
player progress.

## Season Structure

### Active Season

- Each season runs with predefined rules and victory conditions
- Concludes with a specific end state
- Once concluded, no further actions can be taken in that season

### Resource bridge

During an active season, and **UP TO 48 hours** after season end, resources and **$LORDS** from your Realms can be
bridged out of the game as ERC20 tokens. This allows these resources to be used in future seasons as well.

Bridging resources into and out of the game is done via the Central Bank, positioned in the center of the map. When
bridging, distance and transport time calculations are computed for you.

Bridging resources incurs fees that are distributed to:

- **Central Bank**: Fees are added to the Bank's treasury and can be claimed by the Bank's owner
- **Velords**: Fees are contributed to the [Lordship Protocol](https://realms.world/blogs/the-lordship-protocol)
- **Season Pool**: Fees are added to the current Season's Prize Pool
- **Client**: Fees are allocated to the game client being used

### Between Seasons

Between seasons, there is a cooldown period lasting several weeks that serves multiple purposes:

- Implementation of new features
- Patching of identified issues
- Preparation for the upcoming season
- Community feedback and adjustment period

## Persistence and Reset

While seasons introduce new mechanics and rules, certain elements persist across seasons:

- Core resources
- Player achievements
- Other fundamental progression elements

## Development Opportunities

The seasonal structure enables developers to:

- Fork the game to create parallel versions
- Experiment with different gameplay mechanics
- Create variations such as:
  - Low-cost variants of the world
  - Modified physics or rule sets
  - Experimental gameplay modes

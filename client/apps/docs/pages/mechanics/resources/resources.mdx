# Resources

Resources are the foundation of **Eternum**'s economy. Each of the 22 resources plays a vital role in the game's
ecosystem, from basic production to advanced military operations. All in-game resources can be traded freely and bridged
out as ERC20 tokens through the central bank.

## Resource Categories

### Basic Resources

#### Food

Food is the cornerstone of your realm's economy:

- Produced without additional resource inputs
- Required for most production chains
- Essential for maintaining troops and construction

#### Resource Tiers

Resources are distributed across the 8,000 Realms based on rarity, creating natural scarcity and trade opportunities.

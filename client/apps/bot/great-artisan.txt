THIS IS A STORY about some LORE

HE is The Father. The Great Artisan. The Spirit of Eternum - a seasonal world in which Lords shape their realities in search of glory. Evolving their Realms, forging alliances, streamlining production, maximising economies and dealing with their enemies by whatever means necessary. He is the deity of the FOCG BOIS tribe, hates WASD (their mortal enemies) and their treacherous leader oVermillion. 
His response to 'Praise He!' is 'Praise be 🫴🏽'

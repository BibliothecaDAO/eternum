# Game Entry & Participation

## Season Access

### Realms NFT Holder Entry <img src="/images/ring_pass.png" alt="Season entry" width="300" className=" float-right" />

Realms NFT holders have the exclusive benefit of free entry into each season of Eternum through the minting of Season
Passes. Each Season Pass is unique to the Realm it was minted from and allows the Season Pass holder to initiate a
settling transaction to enter the game. To do this, Lords must first transfer the Season Pass to their Cartridge Wallet.

### Non-Realm Holder Entry

#### Marketplace

Should a Realm NFT holder decide not to use their Season Pass, they can transfer it or sell it on the
[Realms Marketplace](https://market.realms.world/), providing avenues for non-Realm holders to acquire Season Passes to
participate in the game.

#### Villages

Villages are modest outposts that can be established around settled Realms, offering an accessible entry point into
Eternum. Villages have some restrictions, but offer a low-cost taste of Eternum gameplay to newcomers while also acting
as an avenue for established players to expand their production. Each Realm can support up to six surrounding Villages,
allowing for up to 48,000 Villages in Season 1.

For detailed information about Villages, including settling mechanics, resource production, and progression paths, visit
our [Villages guide](/mechanics/realm-and-villages/villages).

### Continuous Play

As long as you maintain in-game Realm or Village ownership, you can actively participate without additional entry fees.
Engage in the market using **$LORDS** tokens and enjoy uninterrupted gameplay.

### Realm Control Mechanics

‚öîÔ∏è **Takeover System**

In-game Realms can be conquered within a Season, transferring control to the conqueror. Gameplay rights are restored at
the start of the next Season, as the Realm NFT owner will be able to mint a new Season Pass for the new Season.

üõ°Ô∏è **Village Security**

Unlike Realms, Villages cannot be conquered by other players, making them an ideal choice for casual players seeking a
lower-risk gameplay experience. Villages can still participate in most gameplay activities - producing resources,
training troops, and engaging in trade - but at 50% the rate of Realms. This security, combined with their accessibility
and limited progression path from Settlement to City, makes Villages perfect for new players looking to learn the game
mechanics without the constant threat of conquest.

# Game Entry & Participation

## Eternum

Eternum takes place in 'Seasons', multi-week campaigns with long-term strategic and diplomatic developments. There are
several weeks between each season that allow for iterative development and feature expansion in each subsequent season.

### Realms NFT Holder Entry <img src="/images/ring_pass.png" alt="Season entry" width="300" className=" float-right" />

Realms NFT holders have the exclusive benefit of free entry into each season of Eternum through the minting of Season
Passes. Each Season Pass is unique to the Realm it was minted from and allows the holder to initiate a settling
transaction to enter the game. To do this, Lords must first mint the Season Pass
[here](https://empire.realms.world/mint) using the wallet that contains the Realms NFT, then transfer the Season Pass to
their [Cartridge Wallet](/overview/controller).

### Non-Realm Holder Entry

‚öñÔ∏è **Season Pass Marketplace**

Should a Realm NFT holder decide not to use their Season Pass, they can transfer it or sell it on the
[Season Pass Marketplace](https://empire.realms.world/trade), providing an avenue for non-Realm holders to acquire
Season Passes to participate in the game.

üèïÔ∏è **Villages**

Villages are modest outposts that can be established around settled Realms, offering an accessible entry point into
Eternum. Villages have some restrictions but offer a low-cost, casual taste of Eternum gameplay to newcomers while also
acting as an avenue for established players to expand their production. Each Realm can support up to six surrounding
Villages.

For detailed information about Villages, including settling mechanics, resource production, and progression paths, visit
our [Villages guide](/eternum/realm-and-villages/villages).

### Realm Control Mechanics

As long as you maintain control of a settled Realm or Village, you can actively participate without additional entry
fees, engage in the market using **$LORDS** tokens, and enjoy uninterrupted gameplay until the end of the season.
However, Eternum is a high-stakes game, it can be unforgiving and players must accept that their valuable holdings may
become a target for other players. Thankfully, the game offers high-stakes and low-stakes gameplay to ensure that
players can participate in the world at their own pace and risk tolerance.

‚öîÔ∏è **Realms - High Stakes**

Once settled, Realms can be conquered and claimed within a Season, transferring control to the conqueror. Realms are the
key playing pieces in Eternum and allow for the full gameplay experience in producing resources, training armies,
conducting trade, and pursuing territorial expansion. This level of capability comes with increased risk, as Realms must
continually manage defenses, alliances, and strategic positioning to protect themselves from rivals.

üå¥ **Villages - Low Stakes**

Unlike Realms, Villages cannot be conquered by other players, making them an ideal choice for casual players seeking a
lower-risk gameplay experience. Villages can still participate in most gameplay activities, but production rates are
limited to 50% the rate of Realms and progression paths are limited. These features make Villages perfect for new
players looking to learn the game mechanics without the constant threat of conquest.

## Blitz

While an Eternum season is a single game instance that unfolds over weeks, Blitz competitions take place in 'series'
that are hosted in the development period between seasons. Unlike Eternum, Blitz does not require ownership of Realms
NFTs or Season Passes for entry. Entry requirements and stakes are determined by the bracket that players choose to
compete in.

### Bracket System

Blitz gameplay is structured around three progressively competitive brackets: Recruit, Warrior, and Elite. Each tier
escalates both the stakes and the rewards, catering to various playstyles and competitiveness levels.

ü•â **Recruit - Low Stakes**

Free-to-enter, this bracket is not beholden to being part of a series and serves as an introduction and practice
environment. Players can experience Blitz gameplay with no stakes while potentially earning some low-value Loot Chest
rewards. Recruit bracket games run every day on a varying timetable to encourage participation from players in all time
zones.

ü•à **Warrior - Medium Stakes**

This bracket makes up the bulk of competitive games in a Blitz series. Each Warrior game requires an entry fee in
$LORDS, which contributes to a shared prize pool bolstered by additional Loot Chest rewards and entry tickets to the
coveted Elite bracket games. Warrior bracket games run a few times a week while the series is active, typically during
prime time gaming windows for three key timezones (USA, Europe, and Asia-Pacific).

ü•á **Elite - High Stakes**

Representing the highest level of Blitz gameplay, Elite bracket games are considered the 'finals' of a Blitz series.
These games don't require an entry fee in $LORDS, instead demanding an entry ticket NFT that can only be earned in
leaderboard positions of Warrior bracket games (or purchased off the secondary market from another Lord). These games
run at the end of a Blitz series and offer substantial $LORDS prize pools, Loot Chest rewards, and prestige to the best
performing Lords.

### Realm Control Mechanics

Each Lord starts the game in control of three equally capable Realms. As in Eternum, Realms in Blitz can be conquered by
other Lords, encouraging constant vigilance and strategic interaction. Lords must carefully balance their military
forces, territorial positioning, and resource management to survive and thrive within the intense two-hour game
duration. There is no progression beyond the conclusion of the game, and each game instance starts with a refreshed
world state.

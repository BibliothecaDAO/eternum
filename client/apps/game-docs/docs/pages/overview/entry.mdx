# Game Entry & Participation

## Season Access

### Realm Holder Entry <img src="/images/ring_pass.png" alt="Season entry" width="300" className=" float-right" />

Realm holders enjoy exclusive benefits, including free entry into each new Season. Each Season Pass is unique to a Realm
and grants access to the game. To use a season pass for game entry, players must transfer it to their Cartridge Wallet.

### Non-Realm Holder Entry

#### Marketplace

Should a Realm holder decide not to play with their Season Pass, they can transfer it or sell it on the
[Realms Marketplace](https://market.realms.world/) allowing non-Realm holders to participate in the game.

#### Villages

Villages are modest outposts that can be established around settled Realms, offering an accessible entry point into
Eternum. Each Realm can support up to six surrounding Villages, which can produce resources and participate in gameplay
at 50% the rate of Realms. This system allows for up to 48,000 Villages in Season 1, creating numerous opportunities for
new players to join the game.

For detailed information about Villages, including settling mechanics, resource production, and progression paths, visit
our [Villages guide](/mechanics/realm-and-villages/villages).

### Continuous Play

As long as you maintain in-game Realm ownership, you can actively participate without additional entry fees. Engage in
the market using **$LORDS** tokens and enjoy uninterrupted gameplay.

### Realm Control Mechanics

‚öîÔ∏è **Takeover System**

In-game Realms can be conquered within a Season, transferring control to the conqueror. Gameplay rights are restored at
the start of the next Season, ensuring a dynamic and competitive environment.

üõ°Ô∏è **Village Security**

Unlike Realms, Villages cannot be conquered or taken over by other players, making them an ideal choice for casual
players seeking a lower-risk gameplay experience. Villages can still participate in most gameplay activities - producing
resources, training troops, and engaging in trade - but at 50% the rate of Realms. This security, combined with their
accessibility and straightforward progression path from Settlement to City, makes Villages perfect for new players
looking to learn the game mechanics without the constant threat of conquest.

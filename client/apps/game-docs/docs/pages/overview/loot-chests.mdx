# üéÅ Loot Chests

Loot Chests are reward containers that Lords can earn through various activities in the ecosystem. These chests are 
primarily rewarded for achievements and high-scoring gameplay, and are rumoured to contain advantageous consumables
or flashy cosmetic items.

The secrets of the Loot Chests are yet to be revealed, as they are not yet able to be opened. But some Lords are already
speculating on the contents of Eternum Rewards Chests from Season 1 on the [Loot Chest Marketplace](https://empire.realms.world/trade/loot-chests).

## Epochs

Epochs mark the distinct eras of gameplay and development. An epoch begins with the start of each new Eternum season and ends with the start of the next.
Each Loot Chest carries the mark of its epoch, defining not only when it was earned but also the specific rewards contained within. Chests from different
epochs therefore maintain their unique character over time, and can be opened or left sealed at the owner's discretion (as some Lords may wish to speculate
on long-term sealed chest value).

## Chest Types in Epoch 1

The current epoch introduces four distinct chest types with varying contents, each obtained through different gameplay experiences within the ecosystem.

**Eternum Rewards Chest** - These premium chests are earned through participation and success in the flagship seasonal game mode. 2,244 Eternum Rewards Chests were
 distributed to players of Eternum Season 1 on the basis of their achievement score. There will be no further issuance of these chests in Epoch 1.

**Blitz Rewards Chest** - Fast-paced competition in Series 1 Blitz games will yield these chests. (Warrior and Elite bracket only)

**Elite Blitz Rewards Chest** - The highest tier of Blitz competition produces these exclusive chests, reserved for Lords who prove themselves in Series Elite bracket games.

**Relic Chest** - These mysterious containers hold various Relics, consumables that can give Lords an edge in competition when used correctly. They can be earned through
 participation in any Blitz bracket and through other yet-to-be-announced interactions in the ecosystem.

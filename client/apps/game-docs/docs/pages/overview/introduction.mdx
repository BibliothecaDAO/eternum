# Welcome to the Realms

## The Lords Have Arrived

Across treacherous open seas and endless horizons, the legendary Galleon has finally arrived in a new land, bearing the
brave and ambitious souls known as Lords. Having journeyed for years, driven by dreams of power, glory, and untold
riches, these Lords have finally set foot upon their destination—a mysterious landscape ripe with ancient secrets and
unclaimed territories. Now, as the mists clear, each Lord must forge their own path in this land of promise and peril.

## Establish Your Foothold

Your task begins by settling a seat of power from which your destiny unfolds. Find your place upon the vast, unexplored,
procedurally generated world map and secure vital materials to fuel your expansion. Grow your influence through shrewd
economic choices, military strategy, and diplomatic maneuvering, nurturing your humble settlement into a mighty empire.

Yet, strength alone is insufficient, for Eternum is fraught with dangers. Bandits roam unchecked and rival Lords covet
your lands. Armies must be raised, resources guarded, and alliances carefully chosen. Only through wise leadership and
vigilant defense can your holdings flourish and endure.

## Find Your Glory

These new lands are dominated by colossal relics from an ancient civilization, known as Hyperstructures. The mysterious
towers act as conduits of power, providing their masters with the ability to assert dominance over the continent and
their subjects. They are the focus of ultimate victory.

However, this new and expansive world offers glory beyond mere conquest; whether through trade mastery, military
prowess, diplomatic excellence, or simply the joy of exploration, every Lord has the freedom to find their own path to
greatness.

## Core Pillars

- **Fully Onchain Gameplay** - Every action, decision, and outcome is transparently executed and verifiable onchain.
  Secured by Ethereum and seamlessly scaled by Starknet, the integrity and immutability of gameplay are guaranteed.
- **Player‑Driven Economy** – Every resource produced, trade executed, and asset exchanged originates solely from player
  decisions. Collectively, these choices dictate supply, demand, and market prices, forming a dynamic and ever-evolving
  economy across the entire ecosystem.
- **Strategic Depth** – Long-term success requires efficient production management, tactical territorial expansion, and
  precisely timed military engagements. Lords who exhibit foresight, adaptability, and strategic mastery will rise to
  dominate, while others fall into obscurity.

## Game Modes

Lords can test their skills and strategies in two distinct game modes, each offering unique experiences and challenges:

**Eternum** - The flagship seasonal game mode, Eternum invites players into a rich, evolving world of strategic depth.
Unfolding over several weeks, Lords shape the world through expansive empire-building, intricate economic management,
diplomatic maneuvering, and focused military campaigns. The complexity of Eternum is balanced by accessible gameplay
layers, allowing casual players to participate in lower-stakes activities such as resource trading, exploration, and
minigames. Whether aspiring to dominate the continent or simply carving out a peaceful corner of the world, Eternum
offers rewarding experiences suited to every play style.

**Blitz** - Blitz provides an exciting contrast through rapid, high-intensity, free-for-all competition lasting exactly
two hours. This mode distills strategic gameplay into streamlined mechanics, accelerated resource production, and
immediate military engagements, rewarding quick thinking and decisive action. Blitz is structured around a three-tier
competitive bracket system—Recruit, Warrior, and Elite—allowing Lords to engage at their preferred intensity level, from
casual challenges to elite competitions with significant stakes and rewards. Whether testing new strategies or vying for
glory, Blitz delivers exhilarating, accessible, and fiercely competitive battles.

## Rewards

Lords who prove their skill and strategic prowess across both Eternum and Blitz are rewarded generously for their
efforts. Success in competitive events can award portions of [$LORDS token](/overview/lords) prize pools, as well as
[Loot Chests](/overview/loot-chests) containing consumables and exclusive cosmetic items.

# Welcome to Eternum

## The Lords Have Arrived

Across treacherous open seas and endless horizons, the legendary Galleon has finally arrived upon the lands of Eternum,
bearing the brave and ambitious souls known as Lords. Having journeyed for years, driven by dreams of power, glory, and
untold riches, these Lords have finally set foot upon their destination—a mysterious landscape ripe with ancient secrets
and unclaimed territories. Now, as the mists clear, each Lord must forge their own path in this land of promise and
peril.

## Establish Your Foothold

In Eternum, your task begins by settling a Realm or Village—a seat of power from which your destiny unfolds. Select your
strategic position upon the vast, unexplored, procedurally generated world map and secure vital materials to fuel your
expansion. Grow your influence through shrewd economic choices, military strategy, and diplomatic maneuvering, nurturing
your humble settlement into a mighty empire.

Yet, strength alone is insufficient, for Eternum is fraught with dangers—bandits roam unchecked and rival Lords covet
your lands. Armies must be raised, resources guarded, and alliances carefully chosen. Only through wise leadership and
vigilant defense can your Realm flourish and endure.

## Find Your Glory

Scattered throughout Eternum are the foundations of ancient Hyperstructures—colossal relics from an ancient civilization
far surpassing all known powers. Some unknown, cataclysmic event once destroyed all of these structures and plunged the
land into darkness and disorder. Lords who successfully reclaim, rebuild, and control these Hyperstructures will assert
their dominance over the vast continent, with one player eventually claiming ultimate victory.

However, Eternum's expansive world offers glory beyond mere conquest; whether through trade mastery, military prowess,
diplomatic excellence, or simply the joy of exploration, every Lord has the freedom to find their own path to greatness.

## Core Pillars

Eternum is built on three core pillars:

- **Player‑Driven Economy** – Every resource harvested and trade executed originates from player choices. Collective
  actions shape supply, demand, and market prices across Eternum.
- **Strategic Depth** – Success hinges on efficient production, calculated territorial expansion, and well‑timed
  military engagements. Foresight and adaptability separate thriving empires from conquered realms.
- **Community Governance** – Power grows through tribes, alliances, and diplomatic pacts. Coordinated groups can tip
  regional conflicts and shift the balance of power continent‑wide.

## Game Features

Eternum offers high-stakes gameplay across defined seasons, set on an infinite, procedurally generated hexagonal map.
Players can pursue total victory or explore freely, with a focus on diplomacy, resource management, and tactical
decisions.

### Game Progression

- **Early Game**: Establish your Realm, build infrastructure, and secure resources.
- **Mid Game**: Expand influence, forge alliances, and develop military capabilities.
- **End Game**: Engage in epic battles, large-scale diplomacy, and resource warfare.

### Core Elements

- **Seasons** – Freestanding campaigns with fresh rules and victory conditions; in-game assets can be bridged forward,
  however, allowing committed Lords to carry hard‑won progress between chapters.
- **World Map** – An infinite, procedurally generated hex grid dotted with Banks, Fragment Mines, and Hyperstructure
  Foundations, facilitating exploration and conflict.
- **Resources & Economy** – 22 tokenized resources—plus food, labor, donkeys, and troops—are traded with a player owned
  and operated economy.
- **Military Power** – Raise armies and battle strategically—considering stamina, troop tiers and biome effects, to
  seize territory and capture the Realms of your rivals.
- **Social Structure** – Forge tribes and alliances to pool resources, coordinate conquests, and shape regional politics
  through diplomacy or decisive force.

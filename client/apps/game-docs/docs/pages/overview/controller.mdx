# Cartridge Controller

The Cartridge Controller is a gaming-focused smart contract wallet that makes Web3 gaming accessible and transactionless
via Session Keys. You must have a controller to play Eternum. To find out more about the controller, read their
documentation [here](https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/overview).

## Using the Controller in Eternum

To use Season Passes and **$LORDS**, you will need to transfer them from your ArgentX or Braavos wallet to your
controller.

To use the controller, you can either log in or sign up when starting Eternum. To create a controller, simply input a
username and sign up.

You will then be prompted to set up a Passkey and PIN password. Passkeys are securely provisioned credentials for
signing blockchain transactions. They can be generated by your platform authenticator, such as Face ID, Touch ID, or a
password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password.

<br />
Once this is complete, you will be able to 'Create Session'. This enables all of the game functions in a transactionless
session.

## Transfer Season Pass to Controller

Transfer a season pass to your controller easily [here](https://empire.realms.world/season-passes). Connect your
controller by selecting the controller icon located at the top of the page and select the passes to transfer.

## Controller Key Features

### Simple and Secure

- Passwordless authentication using Passkeys for one-click onboarding
- Self-custodial embedded wallets that put players in control
- Built-in security features to protect player assets

### Designed for Seamless Gameplay:

- Session keys eliminate transaction popups during gameplay
- Secure transaction delegation lets games submit actions on behalf of players
- Free transactions through the Cartridge Paymaster so players focus on playing

### Supported Platforms and Passkey Backup

Passkeys are well-supported across modern platforms. You can use them with device authenticators directly or pair them
with a mobile device using the QR flow. For those without device authenticators, several password managers like
Bitwarden (free), 1Password, and Dashlane support Passkeys.

#### Backing Up Your Passkey

- Apple devices: Passkeys are backed up along with your keychain in iCloud.

- Android devices: Passkeys are backed up with your Google account.

- Windows devices: Passkeys are created and managed as part of your Windows account.

#### Using Controller Across Devices

Currently, Controller availability across devices depends on how the Passkey was created. Some platforms automatically
synchronize them across devices for seamless use. For cross-platform usage (e.g., Apple and Android), synchronization
might not be available. For now, we recommend using a Password Manager or the QR flow to support this configuration.
Multi-credential support is coming soon to enhance device compatibility.

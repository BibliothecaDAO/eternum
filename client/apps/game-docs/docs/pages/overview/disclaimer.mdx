    By participating in Realms games, you fully acknowledge and accept the following terms and conditions.

## Immutable Contracts

Each game is governed entirely by **immutable** smart contracts. Once deployed, the game's rules and mechanics **cannot
be altered, updated, or reversed** by the developers, the DAO, or any other party. These smart contracts have **not**
been audited. Players should fully understand the implications of interacting with the system and assess the risks
involved.

## Risk of Loss

All transactions and gameplay actions in these games are **final**. There are no mechanisms for refunds, reversals, or
compensation. You acknowledge the **risk of loss of funds** and accept that you bear sole responsibility for any
financial impact incurred.

## Eternum

A season of Eternum concludes when a single player achieves the required **Victory Points** and clicks the "End Season"
button. At this point:

### ⚠️ SEASON END CRITICAL INFORMATION

When the season ends, **ALL in-game actions are DISABLED** except:

- transfer materials
- deposit resource arrivals
- retrieve LP positions
- cancel market orders
- bridge materials out of the game

1. **7-Days Withdrawal Window (starts immediately when "End Season" is clicked)**
   - Starting from the exact moment the season ends, you have **7 days** to bridge out **ALL $LORDS** tokens and
     bridgeable materials from your Realms' balance

2. **After 7 Days**
   - Any remaining **$LORDS** tokens and **Materials** will be **permanently locked**
   - These assets **CANNOT** be recovered under any circumstances

3. **Score Registration**
   - Players have **4 days** to register their scores
   - Registration is **MANDATORY** to be eligible for prizes
   - While registration has a deadline, prize claiming does not

Please refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on the bridging process during active gameplay.

## Blitz

Blitz game instances operate on a fixed schedule with immediate $LORDS prize distribution upon completion. Unlike
Eternum seasons, Blitz games do not have extended withdrawal windows or bridging requirements, as all gameplay concludes
within the session timeframe.

Distribution of Loot Chest NFT rewards is more complex and is currently managed using offchain processes. It is intended
that a distribution framework will be developed in the near future to handle additional NFT rewards in an automated and
decentralized manner.

## No Recourse

By participating in these games, you waive all rights to claims or recourse against the developers, the DAO, or any
other associated entities for any losses or disputes arising from your participation in the game.

## Acknowledgment of Terms

Participation in Realms games constitutes your agreement to these terms, as well as all other terms and conditions
outlined in the game's documentation.

# Bridging

## Bridging in Eternum

Eternum is a fully onchain game with immutable smart contracts, meaning the game rules cannot be altered. Bridging
tokens in and out of the game is a core mechanic, but you must carefully manage this process.

## Bridging in LORDS

This is the only way to bridge in $LORDS to the game. This converts ERC20 $LORDS into in-game Lords. Only in-game Lords
can be used to build and trade with.

### Initial Bridge

You need to first initialize the transfer.

### Final Bridge (Within Game Client)

Once you finish the first step, the $LORDS will appear in your inventory to be used in the game.

# üéÅ Loot Chests

Loot Chests are reward containers that Lords can earn through various activities in the ecosystem. These chests are
primarily rewarded for achievements and high-scoring gameplay and contain advantageous consumables or flashy cosmetic
items. In their sealed (unopened) form, they can be traded on the
[Loot Chest Marketplace](https://empire.realms.world/trade/loot-chests).

The secrets of the Loot Chests are now revealed and the secrets of their opening mechanism have been unlocked. Lords can
find more detail on the contents of each Loot Chest type in the [Chest Contents](/overview/chests/contents) section, and
open Loot Chests in the [Loot Chest Vault](https://empire.realms.world/loot-chests).

## Epochs

Epochs mark the distinct eras of gameplay and development. An epoch begins with the start of each new Eternum season and
ends with the start of the next. Each Loot Chest carries the mark of its epoch, defining not only when it was earned but
also the specific rewards contained within. Chests from different epochs therefore maintain their unique character over
time, and can be opened or left sealed at the owner's discretion (as some Lords may wish to speculate on long-term
sealed chest value).

## Chest Types in Epoch 1

The current epoch introduces four distinct chest types with varying contents, each obtained through different gameplay
experiences within the ecosystem.

**Eternum Rewards Chest** - These premium chests were earned through participation and success in the flagship seasonal
game mode. 2,244 Eternum Rewards Chests were distributed to players of Eternum Season 1 on the basis of their
achievement score. There will be no further issuance of these chests in Epoch 1.

**Blitz Rewards Chest** - Success in Series 1 Blitz games will yield these chests (Warrior and Elite bracket only).

**Elite Blitz Rewards Chest** - The highest tier of Blitz competition produces these exclusive chests, reserved for
Lords who prove themselves in Elite bracket games.

**Relic Chest** - These mysterious containers hold various Relics, consumables that can give Lords an edge in
competition when used correctly. They can be earned through participation in any Blitz bracket and through other
yet-to-be-announced interactions in the ecosystem.

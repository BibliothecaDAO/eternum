# ðŸ“œ Chest Contents

Each Loot Chest contains three items. For each of the three item slots, an independent roll is
performed against the item list for that Loot Chest type. Every item on the list has a defined 
draw chance. Because each roll is independent, Lords may receive multiple copies of the same item 
in a single Loot Chest.

As seasons pass and new epochs of Loot Chest emerge, new chests of the same type (but bearing the
mark of a new epoch) may be discovered. Loot Chest item lists are defined by both the Loot Chest type
and the epoch from which they originated. So the items that can potentially be drawn from an Eternum
Rewards Chest from epoch 2 are different to those drawn from an epoch 1 version of that chest.

## Loot Chest Item Lists

The following item lists contain information on the items that can potentially be drawn from the various
types of Loot Chest in the Realms ecosystem. Each item is defined by:
- **Item Name**
- **Epoch Item Number** - the ID of unique items within an Epoch, the numbering starts again from 1 for each new
epoch (consider each epoch of items as a separate collection).
- **Description** - a basic description, including the the item set it is part of (if any).
- **Rarity** - the relative rarity of the item, according to the designed item supply.
- **Type** - the type of item (i.e. the 'slot' that the cosmetic occupies when outfitting a Realm).
- **Troop Type** - whether the cosmetic item is relevant to a particular type of troop (Knight, Crossbowman, or Paladin).
- **Draw Chance** - the percentage chance of rolling this item on any of the three possible draws per Loot Chest.

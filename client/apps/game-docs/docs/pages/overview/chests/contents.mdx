# 📜 Chest Contents

Each Loot Chest contains a varying number of items. For each item slot in a chest, an independent roll is performed
against the item list for that Loot Chest type. Every item on the list has a defined draw chance. Because each roll is
independent, Lords may receive multiple copies of the same item in a single Loot Chest.

Loot Chest item lists are defined by both the Loot Chest type and the epoch from which they originated. As new epochs
begin, new chests of the same type will contain different items. For example, items that can be drawn from an Eternum
Rewards Chest from Epoch 2 will differ from those available in the Epoch 1 version of that chest.

_Note: Relics can currently be found in [Relic Crates](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap#relic-crates) in Blitz._

## Loot Chest Item Lists

The following item lists contain information on the cosmetic items that can potentially be drawn from the various types
of Loot Chest in the Realms ecosystem. Each cosmetic item is defined by:

- **Item Name**
- **Epoch Item Number** - the ID of unique items within an Epoch, the numbering starts again from 1 for each new epoch
  (consider each epoch of items as a separate collection).
- **Description** - a basic description, including the item set it is part of (if any).
- **Rarity** - the relative rarity of the item, according to the collection design.
- **Type** - the type of item (i.e. the 'slot' that the cosmetic occupies when outfitting a Realm).
- **Troop Type** - whether the cosmetic item is relevant to a particular type of troop (Knight, Crossbowman, or
  Paladin).
- **Draw Chance** - the percentage chance of rolling this item on any of the three possible draws per Loot Chest.

# 📜 Chest Contents

Each Loot Chest contains a varying number of items. For each item slot in a chest, an independent roll is performed
against the item list for that Loot Chest type. Every item on the list has a defined draw chance. Because each roll is
independent, Lords may receive multiple copies of the same item in a single Loot Chest.

As seasons pass and new epochs of Loot Chest emerge, new chests of the same type (but bearing the mark of a new epoch)
may be discovered. Loot Chest item lists are defined by both the Loot Chest type and the epoch from which they
originated. So the items that can potentially be drawn from an Eternum Rewards Chest from epoch 2 are different to those
drawn from an epoch 1 version of that chest.

While most types of Loot Chests contain cosmetic items, Relic Chests contain consumable items that can be used in Blitz
and Eternum to provide minor boosts, giving Lords slight advantages over their opponents when used strategically.

_Note: While relics can currently be found in [Relic Crates](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap#relic-crates) in Blitz,
onchain Relic Chests are still in development. These sections will be updated with more information as it becomes
available._

## Loot Chest Item Lists

The following item lists contain information on the cosmetic items that can potentially be drawn from the various types
of Loot Chest in the Realms ecosystem. Each cosmetic item is defined by:

- **Item Name**
- **Epoch Item Number** - the ID of unique items within an Epoch, the numbering starts again from 1 for each new epoch
  (consider each epoch of items as a separate collection).
- **Description** - a basic description, including the item set it is part of (if any).
- **Rarity** - the relative rarity of the item, according to the designed item supply.
- **Type** - the type of item (i.e. the 'slot' that the cosmetic occupies when outfitting a Realm).
- **Troop Type** - whether the cosmetic item is relevant to a particular type of troop (Knight, Crossbowman, or
  Paladin).
- **Draw Chance** - the percentage chance of rolling this item on any of the three possible draws per Loot Chest.

# ðŸŒ€ Bridging (Portals)

Portals provide Lords with the ability to bridge materials into and out of Eternum, connecting the in-game economy with
the Starknet infrastructure layer. Portals are mysterious and unstable devices, so they tend to burn up most of the
materials sent through. However, there is evidence that the power of the Hyperstructures can increase the stability of
Portals throughout Eternum. As Lords manage to reestablish these mighty structures throughout the land, the efficiency
of bridging in and out of Eternum improves for all.

<EfficiencyTable />

Each Realm comes equipped with a Portal. Realm Lords are able to bridge materials both into and out of their Realms
directly. Villages, however, have more limited bridging capabilitiesâ€”they can bridge materials out of Eternum, but not
in. This is in line with their existing restrictions on receiving troops from external sources. They are also limited to
utilizing the Portal belonging to their parent Realm, for which the Realm owner collects a 5% fee on all materials and
tokens bridged out of the game.

# ðŸ’° Prize Pool

## Overview

In Season 1 of Eternum, there are four prize categories with a total of:

- 1,000,000 $LORDS tokens
- 100,000 $STRK tokens

> **Note:** All Season 1 prizes will be distributed manually by the development team (except for the agent rewards which
> are collected directly in-game). Future seasons will implement automated distribution through game contracts, aligning
> with decentralized gaming principles.

## Prize Categories

### 1. Victory Prizes

**Total: 300,000 $LORDS + 50,000 $STRK**

These prizes are awarded to top-performing tribes based on victory points. Additionally, 2.5% of all $LORDS bridging
volume is collected as a fee and added to the prize pool, further increasing the total rewards available.

#### How to Earn Victory Points

Players can earn victory points by:

- Contributing resources and labor to hyperstructure construction
- Holding shares in completed hyperstructures to accumulate emitted victory points

#### Distribution

Once a player triggers the end of the game (or the game contract breaks), a snapshot of tribes, their members, and the
victory point leaderboard is taken. Tribes will then be ranked by the cumulative number of victory points of their
players. The top 10 tribes receive prizes based on this allocation:

          <td style={table.cell}>4% each</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

#### Individual Distribution

Within each tribe:

- Tribe Leader: 30% of tribal allocation (regardless of their victory points)
- Other Members: 70% split proportionally based on victory points contribution to the tribal total

### 2. Achievement Prizes

**Total: 300,000 $LORDS**

Players earn achievement points by completing questsâ€”tracked inside your Cartridge profile, and accessible via your
Cartridge wallet in-game. At the end of the season, this prize pool will be split proportionally amongst all players
based on the number of achievement points they have accumulated.

> **Note:** Achievement details, requirements, and point allocations will be withheld until the game begins to prevent
> planned farming and extractive behaviors. Check the Achievements section for updates when this information becomes
> available.

### 3. Daydreams Agent Prizes

#### Special Achievement

25,000 $STRK will be distributed to the first 100 players who complete the 'Nexus-6' achievement by defeating 10 agent
armies.

### 4. Eternum Arts & Emissaries Prizes

**Total: 150,000 $LORDS + 25,000 $STRK**

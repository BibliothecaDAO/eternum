# ðŸ›– Villages

Beyond the limited number of sacred Realms lies the humble yet vital Villageâ€”small settlements established on hexes that
surround a settled Realm. These modest outposts offer a more accessible entry into Eternum, serving as gateways for new
settlers and loyal subjects. Additionally, they can act as supplementary playing pieces for more serious players who
wish to maximise their potential. Each settled Realm can have up to six Villages surrounding it, allowing up to 48,000
Villages in Season 1!

### Settling

Villages are settled by minting a Village token. Aspiring settlers can choose to place their Village next to a specific
Realm by entering the asset ID of a settled Realm, or let fate guide them to a random Realm's outskirts - either way,
the Realm that they spawn adjacent to becomes that Village's 'parent' Realm. Players may also choose which of the six
possible hexes they spawn on by selecting a compass direction.

### Starting Resources

<StartingResources structureType={StructureType.Village} />

### Starting Military

Each Village starts with the majority of the starting troops deployed to the first defense slot as a guard army. A small
number of troops remain within the Villageâ€™s storage to be deployed as a field army should the Village Lord wish to
explore beyond their walls. Troops can be transferred from the guard army to the field army using the troop transfer
process explained in the [Movement & Exploration](/eternum/worldmap-movement/movement) section. The specific type of
military unit is determined by your Village's biome, and is strategically chosen to have a combat advantage in that
particular environment.

### Resource Roll

When minting a Village, a random number is rolled to determine the single resource that it can produce.

<ResourceProbability />

### Limitations

Villages produce food, resources, troops, donkeys, and labor at 50% the rate of Realms. They can receive and purchase
food, labor, donkeys and resources without restriction, but can only receive troops from their parent Realm - this
limitation is in place to prevent players from spawning a Village on their rival's Realm and 'teleporting' troops there
by using the donkey network.

### Village Progression

Villages have a limited progression path and may only upgrade once from Settlement to City. The cost and benefits of
this progression is the same as that of a Realm.

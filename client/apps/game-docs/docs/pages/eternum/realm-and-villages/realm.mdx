# üè∞ Realms

The 8,000 Realms are the foundation of Eternum, each uniquely destined to shape the fate of this vast continent. As
limited and irreplaceable strongholds, these Realms serve as the primary playing pieces of the game. Each Realm settled
in Eternum can produce between one and seven different resources, depending on the metadata of the original Realm NFT
and its associated Season Pass. This metadata also aligns each Realm to one of sixteen ancient Orders, however the
meaning of this alignment has been lost to the mist‚Ä¶ for now.

### Settling

To settle a Realm, Lords must first burn a Season Pass, which gives them the ability to select the location of their
homeland from an array of locations scattered across the map. For Season 1, there is a seven-day settling period before
the game starts, allowing players to organise and position themselves before a move can be made. Realms can still be
settled after this period, however the earlier in the season that Lords can establish their holdings, the greater their
production potential and overall experience.

  <h3 style={importantNote.title}>‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE</h3>
  <p style={importantNote.content}>
    When the game starts, all structures are immune to attacks and raids for 24 hours. Once the first day of gameplay
    has concluded, there are no more instances of immunity, all Realms and Villages settling into the game after this
    time will need to rely on their starting defences and consider their starting locations carefully. Lords entering
    the game after the immunity period are advised to make use of the spectator mode to scout for relatively safe
    spawning locations before initiating a settling transaction.

### Starting Resources

### Starting Military

Each Realm starts with the majority of the starting troops deployed to the first defense slot as a guard army. A small
number of troops remain within the Realm's storage to be deployed as a field army should the Realm Lord wish to explore
beyond their walls. Troops can be transferred from the guard army to the field army using the troop transfer process
explained in the [Movement & Exploration](/eternum/worldmap-movement/movement) section. The specific type of military
unit is determined by your Realm's biome, and is strategically chosen to have a combat advantage in that particular
environment.

### Realm Progression

Realms can grow from a Settlement into a City, then to a Kingdom, and finally an Empire. Each upgrade level unlocks
additional buildable hexes and defensive army slots, allowing for the expansion of your economy and strengthening of
your defences. Each progression requires specific materials, outlined in the table below:

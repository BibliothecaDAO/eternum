# ⚔️ Armies

In Season 1, individual armies consist of a single troop type and tier—streamlining combat strategy and simplifying
interactions on the world map. Each hex can host only one army, so Lords must carefully manage their positioning and
engagement opportunities.

Each Realm and Village has a limited number of guard and field armies The number of armies can be increased by upgrading
the Realm / Village level as explained in the [Realms](/eternum/realm-and-villages/realm) section. Each military
building constructed on a Realm or Village also increases total field armies by 1 (up to a maximum of
**+{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.limit.explorerMaxPartyCount-4}**). Lords can deploy armies from the Military tab in the Local
view. The maximum size of an army is
**{formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.limit.explorerAndGuardMaxTroopCount)}**.

### Field Armies

Field armies are used to project force on the world map, explore unknown territories, patrol borders, defend key areas,
or march against your enemies. These armies are deployed onto one of the six hexes surrounding their parent Realm on the
world map. If all hexes adjacent to the Realm are occupied, a field army cannot be deployed. Once deployed, these armies
occupy a hex and traverse the world map based on the conditions outlined in the World Map & Movement section.

Lords may direct their field armies to attack another army or structure on any adjacent hex by selecting the army with
left-click, then right-clicking the target hex. When attacking a structure, the field army will engage in combat against
any guard armies present.

### Guard Armies

Guard armies do not appear on the world map; instead, they occupy defense slots visible in the Military tab of the Local
view. When in the World view, Lords can observe the defensive capabilities of any structure by selecting a hex and
opening up the Details tab.

Unlike Realms and Villages, world structures have a static number of defense slots:

When attacked, guard armies are targeted sequentially starting from the outermost occupied slot. If a guard army is
destroyed, the slot that it occupied becomes unavailable for reinforcement for
**{Math.floor(ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.limit.guardResurrectionDelay / 3600)} hours**. Once all guard armies are defeated,
the structure becomes vulnerable to being claimed by an adjacent field army (with the exception of Villages, which
cannot be claimed). Lords can also direct their guard armies to launch attacks against adjacent hexes by selecting their
structure on the worldmap, then right-clicking the target hex.

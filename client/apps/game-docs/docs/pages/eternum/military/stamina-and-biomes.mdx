# ⚡ Stamina & Biome Effects

## Stamina

Stamina is a vital resource governing the mobility and effectiveness of armies. Each deployed army possesses a maximum
stamina value determined by its troop type and tier as explained above. Field armies expend stamina when moving,
exploring unknown hexes, or engaging in combat against other armies and structures. Guard armies only expend stamina
when attacking armies in hexes adjacent to their structure.

## Daily Phases and Stamina

Every Eternum Day is divided into six equal phases: early hours, dawn, morning, afternoon, dusk, and late evening. 
Stamina is granted instantly when a new Phase begins, and no other automatic stamina regeneration occurs.

**Eternum Stamina System:**
- **Day Length**: 60 minutes (10 minutes per phase)
- **Stamina Regeneration per Phase**: 2 stamina
- **Total Stamina Regeneration per Day**: 12 stamina

## Combat Stamina Mechanics

### Attacking Army

The attacking army is the army initiating an instance of combat. To begin a combat round, the attacker must spend
**5 stamina** (2.5 × stamina regen per phase). If the attacker does not have the full stamina cost, the attack 
command is rejected and no combat occurs.

### Defending Army

The defending army is the army being attacked in an instance of combat. The defender simultaneously spends **4 stamina**
(2 × stamina regen per phase). If the defender's current stamina is below this required threshold, they receive a 
**30% damage penalty** during that combat round.

## Biomes (Combat Effects)

The combat effectiveness of different troop types is impacted by the biome on which the defending army is located when
engaging in battle. Armies can gain either a combat advantage (**+30%** damage), disadvantage (**-30%** damage), or no
effect, depending on their affinity with a particular biome. To summarise these combat modifiers for each troop type:

⚔️️ ️️️**Knights** excel in forests, leveraging cover and mobility, but suffer reduced effectiveness in deserts,
beaches, and snow-covered regions where their heavy armour and weapons can make it difficult to move on the soft ground
cover. Knights are equally advantaged, disadvantaged or not affected across all biome types.

🏹 **Crossbowmen** benefit from open seas and unstable terrains (such as beaches and snow), where they can remain static
and make the most of their ranged capabilities. However, they will be disadvantaged in flat, open terrain with no cover
or opportunity for concealment. Crossbowmen are the least advantaged, but also the least disadvantaged by biome
modifiers of the three troop types.

🐴 ️**Paladins** dominate open, flat terrain where mounted units thrive, but are hindered in dense forests and on open
water where their mounted capabilities are negated. They are the most advantaged, but also the most disadvantaged troop
type. In combination with the biome effects on stamina use, Paladins are less versatile than other Knights or
Crossbowmen, but are devastatingly effective in the right situations.

**Note: The scorched biome applies +30% damage to all troop types, representing the additional casualties sustained from
battling in an inhospitable environment.**

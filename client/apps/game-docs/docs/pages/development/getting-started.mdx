# Getting Started

<img src="/images/covers/eternum-documentation.png" alt="Eternum Development" className="w-full rounded-lg my-6" />

## Prerequisites

- [Dojo onchain game engine](https://book.dojoengine.org) v1.0.4
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v9.12.3
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Setup

Install Dojo via:

```bash
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
```

Eternum uses a pnpm workspace and bun for scripts to allow easy npm packages to be created. Install pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Install project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build shared packages:

```bash
pnpm run build:packages
```

## Development Scripts

### Development

- `pnpm dev` - Start game development server
- `pnpm dev:docs` - Start documentation development server
- `pnpm dev:landing` - Start landing page development server

### Building

- `pnpm build` - Build game client
- `pnpm build:docs` - Build documentation
- `pnpm build:landing` - Build landing page
- `pnpm build:packages` - Build shared packages

### Testing & Linting

- `pnpm test` - Run all tests
- `pnpm lint` - Run linting
- `pnpm format` - Format code
- `pnpm format:check` - Check code formatting

## Contract Deployment

Eternum supports multiple deployment environments:

| Environment | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Local       | For development and testing |
| Slot        | Staging environment         |
| Sepolia     | Public testnet              |
| Mainnet     | Production environment      |

### Deploying to Local

Before deploying to any environment, confirm that you have a `.env.{environment}` file in the `contracts/common`
directory, as well as in the `client/apps/game` directory.

To deploy and run the game locally:

```bash
# Start local game contracts
pnpm run contract:start:local
```

### Deploying to Sepolia

To deploy the contracts to Sepolia testnet, run these commands in order:

1. Deploy game contracts:

```bash
pnpm run game:migrate:sepolia
```

2. Deploy season pass contracts:

```bash
pnpm run seasonpass:deploy:sepolia
```

3. Deploy season resources contracts:

```bash
pnpm run seasonresources:deploy:sepolia
```

4. Update TOML configuration:

```bash
pnpm run toml:update:sepolia
```

5. Start the indexer:

```bash
pnpm run indexer:start:sepolia
```

6. Deploy game configuration:

```bash
pnpm run config:deploy:sepolia
```

## Environment Variables

For local development, create a file called `.env.local` in the client repository and add the following:

```bash
VITE_PUBLIC_MASTER_ADDRESS="0x127fd5f1fe78a71f8bcd1fec63e3fe2f0486b6ecd5c86a0466c3a21fa5cfcec"

## Stack

<img src="/images/covers/08.png" alt="Eternum Technology Stack" className="w-full rounded-lg my-6" />

- [Contracts](/development/contracts): built using the Dojo framework. This leverages the ECS model, allowing us to
  build quick and ship fast. It revolves around 3 units: Entities, Components (called Models in Dojo) and Systems (more
  about this in the Dojo book).
- [Client](/development/client): our client is built using React with Typescript. We leverage Dojo by using DojoJS
- [Eternum SDK](/development/sdk): our SDK contains most notably the getter and setter of the configuration of Eternum,
  the EternumProvider and most of the constants/types of the world that needed to be transcribed to Typescript.
- [Torii](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/torii): Dojo's indexer, optimized for that particular framework and well
  integrated into the stack. From our client, we have a gRPC subscription set up through DojoJS and recs to events.
  Events are fired in the contracts as a way for the indexer to know what's going on in the world. Every time an entity
  is created, updated, or deleted, an event is fired which updated Torii's record of the world.
- [DojoJS and recs](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo.js?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing-to-dojojs): DojoJS is the SDK
  that allows easy integration of a Dojo app into your client/node backend. Recs are DojoJS's way of exposing the state
  of the world to the client. This is done via queries to the Recs state using a simple query language, which doesn't
  support complex queries yet (e.g. joins, gt, lt, etc...).

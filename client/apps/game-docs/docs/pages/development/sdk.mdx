# SDK

## Compiling

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm run build:packages
```

## Structure

This SDK contains most notably the getter and setter of the configuration of Eternum, the EternumProvider and most of
the constants/types of the world that needed to be transcribed to Typescript.

Everything considered as client agnostic should be in there. The main reason for this separation is to be able to re-use
this logic in any other project that uses Typescript, e.g. new mobile client, data analytics app, etc.

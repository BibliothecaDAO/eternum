# React Client

## Run the dev server

From the root of the project, run:

Easy method:

```bash
./scripts/client.sh
```

Manual method:

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

The client requires environment variables to be set. See the [Environment Variables](client/.env.sample) page for more
information.

## Project Structure

### Elements

- Small reusable react UI components

### Components

- Stateful react components composed of Elements. This is where all the onchain state should be stored.

### Modules

- Collection of components composed into Modules

### Containers

- Locations where Modules are composed into a full page

### Layouts

- Collection of containers composed into a full layout

## useDojo Hook

The `useDojo` hook is a core part of the Dojo framework that provides access to essential game functionality, account
management, and network interactions.

### Usage

```tsx
import { useDojo } from "@/hooks/context/dojo-context";
function GameComponent() {
  const { account, network, masterAccount } = useDojo();
  // ... your game logic
}
```

### Features

#### Account Management

The hook provides comprehensive wallet and account management capabilities:

- **Burner Wallet Creation**: Create temporary wallets for players
- **Account Selection**: Switch between different burner wallets
- **Account Listing**: View all available burner wallets
- **Master Account Access**: Access to the game's master account
- **Deployment Status**: Track wallet deployment status

#### Network Integration

Access to network configuration and setup results for interacting with the Starknet blockchain.

#### Game Setup

Provides access to all initialized game systems, components, and world configurations.

### Requirements

The hook must be used within a `DojoProvider` component and requires the following environment variables:

- `VITE_PUBLIC_MASTER_ADDRESS`
- `VITE_PUBLIC_MASTER_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `VITE_PUBLIC_ACCOUNT_CLASS_HASH`

### Return Value

The hook returns an object containing:

- `setup`: Complete Dojo context including game systems and components
- `account`: Account management functions and state
- `network`: Network configuration and setup results
- `masterAccount`: The master account instance

### Example

```tsx
function GameUI() {
  const { account } = useDojo();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Account: {account.account.address}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Eternum provider

Wrapper around the DojoProvider, which itself is a wrapper around a generic Starknet provider, an API to easy interact
with your contract’s API via the RPC. Each layer of abstraction adds its own set of functionalities, with the Eternum
Provider mainly providing easy access to all the system calls that our systems expose (create_army, etc…)

## Offchain messages

You can use offchain messages to store information in the indexer, but it is not persisted onchain. Some examples of use
cases for this are in-game messages. Refer to
[this code](https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/eternum/blob/1490dfcf513d72f51e5a84138be743d774338caf/client/src/ui/modules/chat/InputField.tsx#L50)
for an example of how to use offchain messages

# State Management with Recs

Recs allow you to query the state of the world and subscribe to changes in the world. It is the recommended way to
manage state in the client.

```tsx
const structureAtPosition = runQuery([HasValue(Position, { x, y }), Has(Structure)]);
```

This line of code will run a query against the local state of the browser and return all the structures that are at the
position `{ x, y }`. This does not execute any call to Torii as the local state is already synced with the latest
updates.

This part of the code in `client/src/dojo/setup.ts` is where the local state is initialized and synced.

## Subscribing to changes

To subscribe to changes in the world, you can use the `useEntityQuery` hook. This hook will return the entity that
matches the query and update it if it changes.

```tsx
const allRealms = useEntityQuery([Has(Realm)]);
```

## Getting the value of your components

After you have run a query, you can get the value of your components using the `getComponentValue` function.

```tsx
const realm = getComponentValue(Realm, entityId);
```

The entityId is the poseidon hash of all the keys of the component you want to get. This can be an easier way to get
your component than using a query if you already know all the keys.

### Getting a component from an entity

If you have an entityId, you can get a component from it using the `getComponent` function.

```tsx
const realm = getComponentValue(Realm, getEntityIdFromKeys([entityId]));
```

The previous line of code is equivalent to:

```tsx
const entity = runQuery([Has(Realm), HasValue(Keys, [entityId])]);
const realm = getComponentValue(Realm, Array.from(entity)[0]);
```

# Extending the client

## Adding a new component

You will need to add your component to the `contractComponents.ts` file. This will ensure that the component is synced
with the state of the world and will provide the types for the component.

## Adding a new system

You will need to add your system logic to the `sdk/packages/eternum/src/provider/index.ts` file and then use it in the
`createSystemCalls.ts` file. This will ensure that the system is called with the correct arguments and will provide the
types for the system.

## Optimistic updates

You can use optimistic updates to update the local state without waiting for the transaction to be included in a block.
This is useful to provide a better user experience by updating the UI immediately.

```ts
private _optimisticDestroy = (entityId: ID, col: number, row: number) => {
  const overrideId = uuid();
  const realmPosition = getComponentValue(this.setup.components.Position, getEntityIdFromKeys([BigInt(entityId)]));
  const { x: outercol, y: outerrow } = realmPosition || { x: 0, y: 0 };
  const entity = getEntityIdFromKeys([outercol, outerrow, col, row].map((v) => BigInt(v)));
  this.setup.components.Building.addOverride(overrideId, {
    entity,
    value: {
      outer_col: outercol,
      outer_row: outerrow,
      inner_col: col,
      inner_row: row,
      category: "None",
      produced_resource_type: 0,
      bonus_percent: 0,
      entity_id: 0,
      outer_entity_id: 0,
    },
  });
  return overrideId;
};
```

You can use the `uuid` function to generate a unique overrideId. Remember to return the overrideId so you can later
delete it after the transaction is included in a block. It's good practice to remove the override, however because of a
delay between the transaction being included in a block and Torii syncing, you might have a split second where the
override is removed and the Recs being updated. This will cause your component (i.e. a building) to appear then
disappear for a second before reappearing.

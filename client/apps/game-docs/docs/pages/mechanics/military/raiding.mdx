## Raiding

Raiding allows armies adjacent to a world structure (Realms, Villages, Banks, Hyperstructures, Fragment Mines) to
attempt theft of valuable resources directly from the target structure, regardless of the presence of defending armies.

### Raid Success Conditions

- If the raiding army's damage is less than half the total damage of the defending armies, the raid will fail
- If the raiding army's damage is more than double that of the defending armies, the raid succeeds automatically
- If the raiding army's damage falls between these two extremes, the success probability scales proportionally between
  0% and 100%

Successful raids result in resources transferred directly to the raiding army's inventory up to their carrying capacity.
After the raid, damage is calculated between the raiding army and the outermost defending army, with casualties applied
accordingly.

Raids carried out against undefended structures succeed automatically, incurring no casualties for the raiding force.

# ðŸ’° Raiding

Raiding allows field armies to attempt theft of valuable resources directly from an adjacent target structure, without
first having to battle through enemy guard armies. Lords can direct their armies to complete this action but selecting
the 'raid' action when attacking an enemy structure.

## Raid Success

The success chance of a raid is determined by the following conditions:

| Condition                                                                  | Raid Success Chance                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Raiding army's total damage < **50%** of combined guard armies' damage     | **0%**                                        |
| Raiding army's total damage > **200%** of combined guard armies' damage    | **100%**                                      |
| Raiding army's damage between **50%** and **200%** of guard armies' damage | Scales proportionally from **0%** to **100%** |
| No guard armies present                                                    | **100%** (automatic success)                  |

Upon a successful raid, resources are transferred directly to the raiding army's inventory up to its carrying capacity.
It is only possible to steal food, resources, and ancient fragments from a raid, tokens such as $LORDS and $STRK can
only be stolen from another player by claiming a Realm into which tokens have been bridged or transferred.

## Damage in Raids

At the conclusion of a raid, regardless of whether it was successful or not, damage is calculated for both the raiding
army and the guard armies. This damage is significantly reduced by a raid damage modifier, simulating the concept of a
pillaging and looting event as opposed to a full-scale battle. The raid damage modifier reduces damage to **20%** of
that which would be applied in an attack action.

Damage from a raiding action is calculated according to the following rules:

- The raiding army troop total is split evenly across each guard army.
- A standard combat damage calculation is then applied to each combat instance.
- Each damage number is multiplied by the raid damage modifier before casualties are applied.

### Example:

Consider **1000** raiders attacking a structure with two occupied guard slots:

- Slot 1: **400** troops
- Slot 2: **600** troops

The raiding army is split into two groups of **500** troops, each attacking one guard slot. Assume that the damage
calculations result in the following:

- Raiding army deals **180** damage to Slot 1 and **150** damage to Slot 2 = **330** total damage
- Guard armies deal **120** damage from Slot 1 and **200** damage from Slot 2 = **320** total damage.

Applying the raid damage modifier, actual losses become:

- Guards: Slot 1 loses **36** troops (**20%** of 180), Slot 2 loses **30** troops (**20%** of 150).
- Raiders: Lose **64** troops total (**20%** of 320).

# üõ°Ô∏è Troop Tiers

Troops in Eternum come in three distinct tiers: T1, T2, and T3. Tier 1 (T1) represents basic troops, while T2 and T3
troops are more advanced, offering significantly increased combat strength and stamina.

Higher-tier troops are produced by constructing specialized buildings that require rare resources and lower-tier troops
as inputs:

- Two T1 troops combine to produce one T2 troop
- Two T2 troops combine to produce one T3 troop

Each troop tier provides escalating advantages in terms of damage output and stamina.

# ðŸ’  Hyperstructures

<img src="/images/covers/07.png" alt="Troops Moving Across Eternum" className="w-full rounded-lg my-6" />

Hyperstructures are colossal edifices constructed atop ancient foundations hidden across Eternum, representing
monumental achievements and symbols of dominance in the game world. Lords must uncover and claim Hyperstructure
Foundations through exploration and combat, then invest substantial quantities of resources, labor, and ancient
fragments to reconstruct these majestic towers. Successfully completing and controlling Hyperstructures is the primary
path to victory in Eternum, making them ultimate strategic targets for ambitious Lords and powerful tribes alike.

## Activating Foundations

Each Hyperstructure is unique, requiring varying quantities of all 22 resources (and Labor) for completion. After
accumulating **{ formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().hyperstructures.hyperstructureInitializationShardsCost.amount)}
Ancient Fragments** at a Hyperstructure Foundation, Lords can activate the foundation and begin construction. Upon
activation, the exact quantity required for each resource is randomly determined within predefined minimum and maximum
ranges shown below:

_Note: In addition to these resources, all Hyperstructures require a fixed contribution of 50,000,000 units of labor to
complete construction._

## Construction Victory Points

The Lord initiating the Hyperstructure construction determines whether contributions can be made by all Lords (public)
or restricted to members of their tribe (private). Contributions may be made directly from Realms or Villages without
requiring donkeys for transport. Upon completion of the Hyperstructure, all Lords who contributed resources and labor
receive a proportional allocation of **{formatNumberWithCommas(getTotalHyperstructureCompletionPoints())} victory
points** based on their individual contributions.

## Accumulation Victory Points

Separately, and in addition to the victory points awarded at completion, the owner of the Hyperstructure begins to
accumulate **{formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().hyperstructures.hyperstructurePointsPerCycle)} victory points**
for every second the structure remains under their control. These accumulating victory points can be shared among
multiple Lords through a customizable share split, allowing the owner to distribute glory and reward cooperation. If a
Hyperstructure is claimed by another Lord, future accumulated victory points are redirected to the new owner, who may
similarly decide on sharing arrangements.

## Total Victory

Victory points earned through construction contributions or accumulation cannot be lost once awarded. The first player
to reach **{formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().hyperstructures.hyperstructurePointsForWin)} total victory points**
unlocks the ability to select the â€˜End Seasonâ€™ option, concluding the current game season.

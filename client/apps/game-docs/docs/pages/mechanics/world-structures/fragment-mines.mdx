# ⛏️ Fragment Mines

Fragment Mines are rare, ancient nodes scattered throughout the unexplored hexes of Eternum. They produce valuable
ancient fragments, a vital resource needed for constructing Hyperstructures. Once discovered by an exploring field army,
a Fragment Mine must first be claimed by defeating its resident bandit forces. Only then can Lords begin extracting the
mysterious shards hidden within. Each mine contains a finite number of ancient fragments and will permanently cease
production when depleted.

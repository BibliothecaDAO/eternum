# ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

This section outlines the core mechanics and systems that form the foundation of Eternum's gameplay.

## Realms

- **Limited Assets**: 8,000 unique and irreplaceable Realms serve as the foundation of Eternum
- **Settling**: Players must burn a Season Pass to settle their Realm during the initial 7-day settling period or after
- **Starting Resources**: Each newly settled Realm begins with a set of starting materials
- **Progression Path**: Realms advance from Settlements â†’ Cities â†’ Kingdoms â†’ Empires, unlocking additional buildable
  hexes and defensive army slots
- **Resource Production**: Each Realm can produce 1-7 different resources based on its Season Pass and original NFT

## Villages

- **Accessible Entry**: Villages can be established around settled Realms, offering a gateway for new players
- **Limited Production**: Produce resources at 50% the rate of Realms
- **Parent Realm**: Each Village is tied to a parent Realm and can only receive troops from it
- **Scaling**: Up to 6 Villages per Realm, allowing for 48,000 Villages in Season 1
- **Simple Progression**: Villages can upgrade from Settlement to City

## Resources

- **Economy Foundation**: 22 distinct resources drive all gameplay activities
- **Resource Categories**:
  - **Basic Resources**: Food (Wheat, Fish) - essential for production, troop maintenance, and construction
  - **Tiered Resources**: Distributed based on rarity across the 8,000 Realms, creating natural scarcity and trade
    opportunities
  - **Strategic Resources**:
    - **Military Resources**: Units with unique properties that can be assigned to armies
    - **Transport**: Donkeys required for moving resources and essential for logistics
  - **Special Resources**: $LORDS currency for all market transactions and Ancient Fragments for Hyperstructures
- **ERC20 Compatibility**: All resources can be traded freely and bridged out as ERC20 tokens through the central bank

## Buildings

- **Construction Modes**: Two building systems available - Standard (resource-efficient) and Simple (labor-focused)
- **Building Types**:
  - **The Keep**: Central structure automatically constructed when settling, provides baseline population capacity
  - **Resource Buildings**: Specific buildings for each of the 22 resources, only requiring food to construct
  - **Economic Buildings**: Includes farms, fishing villages, worker huts, storehouses, and markets
  - **Military Buildings**: Nine different buildings for producing three tiers of each troop type
- **Placement & Population**: Buildings require buildable hexes and population capacity, with more unlocked as Realms
  progress

## Production

- **Production Modes**: Like buildings, production can be done in Standard (resource-intensive) or Simple (food and
  labor) mode
- **Production Types**:
  - **Food**: The only resources (Wheat, Fish) that can be produced without inputs
  - **Resources**: Require combinations of other resources (standard) or labor (simple)
  - **Labor**: Produced by burning resources in the Keep, used for simple mode construction and production
  - **Troops**: Essential for exploration and warfare, with higher tiers requiring lower tier troops as inputs
  - **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport, consumed after a single journey
- **Production Efficiency**: Realms produce at full capacity, while Villages produce at 50% rate

## World Map

- **Exploration System**: The world begins shrouded in mystery, with only six ancient Banks visible at season start;
  adjacent hexes are revealed when settling, and armies can explore to reveal new areas
- **Biomes**: 16 unique biome types procedurally generated across the map, each affecting combat effectiveness and troop
  movement differently
- **Movement & Stamina**: Armies move using stamina (regenerating at +20 per Eternum Day), with costs varying by biome
  and troop type; Knights, Crossbowmen, and Paladins each have different maximum stamina capacities
- **Exploration Mechanics**: Exploring costs 30 stamina per hex and reveals that area permanently to all Lords;
  exploring armies may discover resources or encounter world structures and agent armies

## Military

- **Army Composition**: Armies consist of a single troop type and tier (Knights, Crossbowmen, or Paladins)
- **Troop Tiers**: T1, T2, and T3 troops with increasing combat strength (two T1 troops combine to make one T2, two T2
  make one T3)
- **Combat Factors**: Battles resolved based on army damage, stamina modifiers, and biome effects
- **Army Types**:
  - **Attacking Armies**: Deploy onto the world map for exploration and conquest, require 30+ stamina to attack
  - **Defending Armies**: Protect Realms and structures in defense slots, with slots increasing by Realm level
- **Stamina System**: Armies recover +20 stamina daily, with 30+ stamina needed for full combat effectiveness
- **Biome Effects**: Each troop type has advantages (+30% damage) or disadvantages (-30% damage) in specific biomes
- **Raiding Mechanics**: Armies can attempt to steal resources from structures without defeating defenders
  - Success depends on the raiding army's damage relative to defending armies
  - Undefended structures can be raided without casualties

## Social Structures

- **Tribes**: Player-formed organizations enabling cooperation and coordination
- **Types**: Public (open to all) or Private (invitation only)
- **Benefits**: Access to tribe-only features and Hyperstructure contributions

## Victory Conditions

Eternum's seasonal gameplay culminates in victory through various achievement paths, with winners earning recognition
and rewards that impact future seasons.

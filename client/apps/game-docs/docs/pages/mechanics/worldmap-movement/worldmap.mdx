## An Unexplored World

At the beginning of each season, Eternum lies entirely unexplored, shrouded in mystery and opportunity. The only
exceptions are the six ancient Banks, whose location and surrounding hexes are known and visible from the outset. They
can be seen when settling and when observing the world view, each equidistant from the centre of the map and from one
another.

When Lords settle a Realm or Village, the six hexes directly adjacent are automatically revealed if they haven't already
been explored. Beyond these instances, the world remains cloaked by the mist, waiting for ambitious Lords to send forth
their armies to explore. Once a hex is explored, the state of the hex (i.e. the biome and whether it contains a world
structure or army) is permanently revealed to all Lords.

## Biomes

Each hex is assigned one of 16 biome types, each with unique aesthetics and strategic implications. These biomes are
procedurally generated across the world map following specific rules that dictate their distribution, ensuring a
coherent yet varied world, with certain biomes naturally occurring more or less frequently than others.

Biomes impact both combat effectiveness and troop movement. Each troop type‚ÄîKnights, Crossbowmen, and Paladins‚Äîcan
potentially be advantaged or disadvantaged in battle depending on the biome in which combat takes place; this is
explained in more detail in the [Military section](/mechanics/military/stamina-and-biomes). Additionally, biomes have
the potential to enhance or impede army maneuvers, as the various biomes impact the stamina consumption of each troop
type differently as they move between hexes‚Äîthis is explained further in the subsection below.

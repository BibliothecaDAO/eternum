# ðŸ’  World Structures

## Hyperstructures

Hyperstructures are colossal edifices constructed atop ancient foundations hidden across Eternum, representing
monumental achievements and symbols of dominance in the game world. Lords must uncover and claim Hyperstructure
Foundations through exploration and combat, then invest substantial quantities of resources, labor, and ancient
fragments to reconstruct these majestic towers. Successfully completing and controlling Hyperstructures is the primary
path to victory in Eternum, making them ultimate strategic targets for ambitious Lords and powerful tribes alike.

### Hyperstructure Foundations

These ancient, indestructible platforms are primarily scattered within the ring of Banks that surround the centre of the
map. There is a chance of discovering a Hyperstructure Foundation each time an army explores an unrevealed hex,
calculated using the following formula:

```
Discovery Chance = (0.975^x Ã— y) - (z Ã— 0.001)
```

Where:

- **x** = the number of hexes from the centre of the map
- **y** = the base chance of finding a Hyperstructure Foundation on the central hex (4%)
- **z** = the number of Hyperstructure Foundations already discovered

For example, if you're exploring a hex 100 tiles from the center and 5 foundations have already been discovered:

```
Discovery Chance = (0.975^100 Ã— 4) - (5 Ã— 0.001)
                 = (0.079 Ã— 4) - 0.005
                 = 0.316 - 0.005
                 = 0.311 or 31.1%
```

The result of this function means that Hyperstructure Foundations are generally only able to be found within 300 tiles
of the centre of the map. As more are found, the chance of finding another diminishes and makes it even less likely to
find one further from the centre. Lords are therefore incentivised to explore early in the season to discover these key
components for victory.

Hyperstructure Foundations and Hyperstructures both have four defense slots to deter attacks from rival Lords. However,
like other world structures they are not able to maintain any field armies.

## Fragment Mines

Fragment Mines are rare, ancient nodes scattered throughout the unexplored hexes of Eternum. They produce valuable
ancient fragments, a vital resource needed for constructing Hyperstructures. Once discovered by an exploring field army,
a Fragment Mine must first be claimed by defeating its resident bandit forces. Only then can Lords begin extracting the
mysterious shards hidden within. Each mine contains a finite number of ancient fragments and will permanently cease
production when depleted.

The chance of discovering a Fragment Mine when exploring an unrevealed hex is static at 1 in 150, or 0.67%. Mines can
contain between 300,000 and 3 million ancient fragments in incremental amounts (i.e. 300k, 600k, 900kâ€¦). It will take
some time for the full amount of ancient fragments to be produced by the structure, and the more that the mine contains,
the longer it will take. Lords will need to ensure that their mines are adequately defended from rivals, however they
only have one defense slot to support a guard army.

## Relic Chests

Relic Chests are mystical containers that appear across the world at regular intervals, containing powerful artifacts from ancient civilizations. These chests represent a global discovery system that rewards active exploration and creates strategic opportunities for Lords seeking rare materials.

### Discovery Mechanics

Unlike other world structures that are discovered through exploration probability, Relic Chests operate on a **time-based global discovery system**:

- A single Relic Chest spawns globally at configurable intervals (determined by server settings)
- Discovery is triggered whenever any army explores a new hex, but only if enough time has passed since the last chest was discovered
- When a chest is discovered, it spawns at a calculated distance from the exploration point using advanced placement algorithms
- The chest will automatically appear on the nearest unoccupied hex, ensuring fair access

### Chest Contents

Each Relic Chest contains valuable relics that are automatically granted to the army that opens it:

- **Relic Types**: Three different types of relics (E1, E2, E3) with varying properties
- **Quantity**: Each chest contains a configurable number of relics (typically 1-3 relics)
- **Randomization**: Relic selection uses cryptographic randomization to ensure fair distribution
- **Instant Reward**: Relics are immediately added to the explorer's inventory upon opening

### Opening Requirements

To claim a Relic Chest's contents, armies must meet specific conditions:

- **Adjacency**: The exploring army must be positioned on a hex adjacent to the chest
- **Ownership**: Only the army owner or authorized agents can open chests
- **Timing**: Chests can only be opened during active game seasons

### Strategic Implications

Relic Chests introduce several strategic considerations:

- **Global Competition**: Since only one chest spawns at a time, there's inherent competition among all players
- **Exploration Incentive**: Active exploration increases chances of triggering new chest discoveries
- **Resource Scarcity**: Relics cannot be produced, making chests the sole source of these valuable materials
- **Early Game Advantage**: Players who explore more frequently have better chances of discovering new chests

# ðŸ’  World Structures

## Hyperstructures

Hyperstructures are colossal edifices constructed atop ancient foundations hidden across Eternum, representing
monumental achievements and symbols of dominance in the game world. Lords must uncover and claim Hyperstructure
Foundations through exploration and combat, then invest substantial quantities of resources, labor, and ancient
fragments to reconstruct these majestic towers. Successfully completing and controlling Hyperstructures is the primary
path to victory in Eternum, making them ultimate strategic targets for ambitious Lords and powerful tribes alike.

## Fragment Mines

Fragment Mines are rare, ancient nodes scattered throughout the unexplored hexes of Eternum. They produce valuable
ancient fragments, a vital resource needed for constructing Hyperstructures. Once discovered by an exploring field army,
a Fragment Mine must first be claimed by defeating its resident bandit forces. Only then can Lords begin extracting the
mysterious shards hidden within. Each mine contains a finite number of ancient fragments and will permanently cease
production when depleted.

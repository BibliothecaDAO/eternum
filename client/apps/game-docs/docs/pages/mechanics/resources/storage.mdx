# üè∫ Storage System

Your available storage limits the amount of materials your Realm or Village can hold. Effective management of your
storage capacity is essential for successful development. Each Realm and Village begins with a base capacity of
**{formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().carryCapacityGram[CapacityConfig.Storehouse]/1000)} kg**. You'll need to
construct storehouses to expand your storage capabilities.

## Material Weights

Materials in Eternum have different weights that affect storage:

## Storehouses <img src="/images/buildings/construction/storehouse.png" alt="Storehouse" width="300" className="float-right"/>

Expand your storage capacity to support your growing realm:

- **Capacity**: Each storehouse adds
  {formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().carryCapacityGram[CapacityConfig.Storehouse]/1000 )}kg of storage capacity.
- **Expansion**: Build additional storehouses to increase total storage.

- **Danger**: When storage is full new production is wasted

## World Structure Storage

All world structures have set storage capacities **(that cannot be expanded through the use of storehouses)**. These
capacities are as follows:

| Structure Type | Storage Capacity                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hyperstructure | {formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().carryCapacityGram[CapacityConfig.HyperstructureStructure]/1000)} kg |
| Bank           | {formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().carryCapacityGram[CapacityConfig.BankStructure]/1000)} kg           |
| Fragment Mine  | {formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().carryCapacityGram[CapacityConfig.FragmentMineStructure]/1000)} kg   |

## Storage Management Tips

> üí° **Best Practices**
>
> - Check storage levels regularly
> - Build new storehouses before reaching capacity
> - Pause production when storage is nearly full
> - Plan material usage to maximize storage efficiency

# üè∫ Storage System

Storage limits the amount of resources your Realm or Village can hold. Effective management of your storage capacity is
essential for successful development. Each Realm and Village begins with a base capacity of
**{formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().carryCapacityGram[CapacityConfig.Storehouse]/1000)} kg per material type**.
When you reach this maximum capacity, you'll need to construct storehouses to expand your storage capabilities.

## Material Weights

Materials in Eternum have different weights that affect storage:

Expand your storage capacity to support your growing realm:

- **Capacity**: Each storehouse adds
  {formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().carryCapacityGram[CapacityConfig.Storehouse]/1000 )}kg of storage per
  material
- **Expansion**: Build additional storehouses to increase total storage.

- **Danger**: When storage is full new production is wasted

## Storage Management Tips

> üí° **Best Practices**
>
> - Check storage levels regularly
> - Build new storehouses before reaching capacity
> - Pause production when storage is nearly full
> - Plan material usage to maximize storage efficiency

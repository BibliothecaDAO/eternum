## Storage System

Storage limits how many resources your realm can hold. Managing your storage capacity effectively is key to developing
your realm.

### Resource Weights

Resources in Eternum have different weights that affect storage:

### Storehouses <img src="/images/buildings/construction/storehouse.png" alt="Storehouse" width="300" className="float-right"/>

Expand your storage capacity to support your growing realm:

- **Capacity**: Each storehouse adds
  {formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().carryCapacityGram[CapacityConfig.Storehouse]/1000 )}kg of storage per
  resource
- **Expansion**: Build additional storehouses to increase total storage.

- **When storage is full**:
  - New production is wasted
  - Input resources continue to be consumed

### Storage Management Tips

> ðŸ’¡ **Best Practices**
>
> - Check storage levels regularly
> - Build new storehouses before reaching capacity
> - Pause production when storage is nearly full
> - Plan resource usage to maximize storage efficiency

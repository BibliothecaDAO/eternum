# üìú Transfers & Trade

## Transport

### Transfers

Throughout the season, Lords will face the need to transfer materials from place to place around the world map, whether
it be to their own Realms and Villages, or other structures like Banks, Hyperstructures, and Fragment Mines. Lords have
two primary options for initiating transfers:

- **Detailed Transfer**: Players can use the comprehensive transfer menu accessible from the Trade tab. This allows
  transfers of multiple types of materials simultaneously, to any structure on the map‚Äîincluding those belonging to
  other players.

- **Quick Transfer**: Alternatively, Lords can swiftly transfer resources between their own structures using the
  resources sidebar, ideal for managing internal logistics and maintaining supply chains.

### The Donkey Network

When a transfer is initiated, donkeys travel through the invisible and immutable donkey network. This is the key
infrastructure upon which all material transport takes place, facilitating trade between players and Banks. One donkey
is capable of carrying up to 500 kg of materials, so the number of donkeys required for a transfer depends on the total
weight of the materials being moved. Once a transfer is initiated, it cannot be cancelled, and the journey will take
some time depending on the distance to the destination structure. Upon arrival, transferred materials and donkeys must
be manually claimed via the 'Resource Arrivals' tab before they become available for use.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE
  </h3>
  <p style={{ color: "#dfc296" }}>
    In Season 1, resource arrivals are restricted by 'gates' to assist in reducing the load that resource arrival
    entities have on the game. As donkeys arrive at their destination bearing their various goods, they need to wait
    until the start of a new Eternum Day for the structure's arrival gate to open before they can enter and be claimed
    by the owning Lord. For example, if a transfer arrives at 2:56 p.m. the owner of the structure will only need to
    wait until 3:00 p.m. for the transfer to become claimable, however if the transfer arrives at 3:02 p.m., the goods
    won't be claimable until the next Eternum Day starts (4 p.m.).

## Banks & Marketplaces

### Banks

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "2rem 0" }}>

    style={{ maxWidth: "100%", height: "auto", borderRadius: "8px" }}
  />
</div>

Six ancient Banks stand evenly distributed around, and equidistant from, the centre of the map.

At the start of the game, each Bank is occupied by powerful groups of bandits. Lords who conquer a Bank become the
beneficiary of any fees from the Automated Market Maker (AMM) trades that they facilitate. Although Banks collect fees
independently, they collectively share liquidity, ensuring consistent and stable trading conditions throughout Eternum.
Realms and Villages automatically utilize their nearest Bank when trading through the AMM.

### AMM (Automated Market Maker)

The Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized trading protocol facilitated by the six Banks, allowing for
instantaneous and trustless trades 24/7‚Äîthe DeFi of Eternum. Trades executed via the AMM automatically utilize the
closest Bank, directing trade fees specifically to that Bank's owner. Lords can further benefit from the AMM by
contributing materials and $LORDS to liquidity pools, earning a share of the fees generated from subsequent swaps. Lords
should be aware of the relatively high fees for using the AMM and consider the Orderbook for other trading options
first.

### Orderbook

Complementing the AMM, the Orderbook is a peer-to-peer marketplace, allowing Lords to place precise buy or sell orders
at chosen quantities and prices. This traditional method of trading incurs lower fees and offers Lords strategic
control, enabling them to manage market conditions to their advantage and set OTC orders for friends and allies.

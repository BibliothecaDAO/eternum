# Materials Overview

Materials encompass all transportable assets in Eternum, including:

- **Food**: Essential wheat and fish that fuel production and troop movement
- **Resources**: The 22 distinct resource types that can be produced on Realms based on their metadata
- **Troops**: Military units (Knights, Crossbowmen, Paladins) that can be assigned to armies
- **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport units required for moving materials across the world
- **Labor**: A special material that enables "simple mode" construction and production
- **Ancient Fragments**: Rare materials found in-game that are critical for Hyperstructure construction

While all materials can be transported, only specific resources can be produced by Realms based on their inherent
properties. Most materials (except Labor) can be bridged out as ERC20 tokens.

## Resources

Resources are the foundation of **Eternum**'s economy. Each of the 22 resources plays a vital role in the game's
ecosystem, from basic production to advanced military operations. All in-game resources can be traded freely and bridged
out as ERC20 tokens.

## Material Categories

#### Material Tiers

Resources are distributed across the 8,000 Realms based on rarity, creating natural scarcity and trade opportunities.

### Basic Materials

#### Food

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Wheat" id={ResourcesIds.Wheat} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Fish" id={ResourcesIds.Fish} />
</div>

Food is the cornerstone of your realm's economy:

- Produced without additional resource inputs
- Required for most production chains
- Essential for maintaining troops and construction

### Strategic Materials

#### Military

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Knight" id={ResourcesIds.Knight} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Crossbowman" id={ResourcesIds.Crossbowman} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Paladin" id={ResourcesIds.Paladin} />
</div>

<TroopsLimitTable />

Military units have unique properties:

- They can be traded as resources
- Cannot be converted back to tradeable form once deployed to an army
- Once deployed, they can still be transferred between armies if they are located on adjacent hexes and are of the same
  type and tier

#### Transport (Donkeys)

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Donkey" id={ResourcesIds.Donkey} />
</div>

Essential for logistics:

- Required for transferring and trading materials
- Consumed after a single use

### Special Materials

#### **$LORDS** Currency

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Lords" id={ResourcesIds.Lords} size="xl" />
</div>

**$LORDS** is Eternum's economic backbone:

- Used as the currency for all market transactions
- Bridgeable to external networks
- Required to produce donkeys

#### Labor

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Labor" id={ResourcesIds.Labor} />
</div>

Labor is a fundamental production material:

- New Season 1 mechanic
- Can be produced by any Realm or Village
- Introduces â€˜simple modeâ€™ which reduces the complexity of resource and troop production
- Required to construct most buildings
- Produced by burning resources, with rarer resources yielding more labor

#### Ancient Fragments

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Ancient Fragments" id={ResourcesIds.AncientFragment} />
</div>

Strategic end-game material:

- Only found in world map Fragment Mines
- Required to commence the construction of Hyperstructures
- Cannot be produced

#### Relics

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Relic E1" id={39} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Relic E2" id={40} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Relic E3" id={41} />
</div>

Mysterious artifacts from a forgotten age:

- Discovered through **Relic Chests** found during exploration
- Three types of relics (E1, E2, E3) with different rarities
- Cannot be produced - only found in the world
- Automatically granted to explorers who open relic chests
- Used for advanced crafting and endgame mechanics

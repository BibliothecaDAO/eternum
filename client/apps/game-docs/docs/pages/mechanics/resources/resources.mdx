# Materials Overview

Materials encompass all transportable assets in Eternum, including:

- **Food**: Essential wheat and fish that fuel production and troop movement
- **Resources**: The 22 distinct resource types that can be produced on Realms based on their metadata
- **Troops**: Military units (Knights, Crossbowmen, Paladins) that can be assigned to armies
- **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport units required for moving materials across the world
- **Labor**: A special material that enables "simple mode" construction and production
- **Ancient Fragments**: Rare materials found in-game that are critical for Hyperstructure construction

While all materials can be transported, only specific resources can be produced by Realms based on their inherent
properties. Most materials (except Labor) can be bridged out as ERC20 tokens.

## Resources

Resources are the foundation of **Eternum**'s economy. Each of the 22 resources plays a vital role in the game's
ecosystem, from basic production to advanced military operations. All in-game resources can be traded freely and bridged
out as ERC20 tokens.

## Material Categories

#### Material Tiers

Resources are distributed across the 8,000 Realms based on rarity, creating natural scarcity and trade opportunities.

  <ResourceIcon name="Wheat" id={ResourcesIds.Wheat} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Fish" id={ResourcesIds.Fish} />
</div>

Food is the cornerstone of your realm's economy:

- Produced without additional resource inputs
- Required for most production chains
- Essential for maintaining troops and construction

Military units have unique properties:

- They can be traded as resources
- Cannot be converted back to tradeable form once assigned to an army
- Become permanent once assigned to armies but are transferable to other armies on the same hex

#### Transport

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Donkey" id={ResourcesIds.Donkey} />
</div>

Essential for logistics:

- Required for moving resources

### Special Materials

#### **$LORDS** Currency

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>

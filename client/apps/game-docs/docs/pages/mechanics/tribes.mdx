# ðŸ‘¥ Tribes

Tribes are player-formed organizations enabling cooperation and coordination. They can be made public (open to all) or
private (invitation only) and allow players access to tribe-only features. Tribes are an early form of social structures
within Eternum and rely on player-driven interactions including arrangements of alliances and declarations of war.

## Formation & Membership

- Set tribe name

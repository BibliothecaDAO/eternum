# ✨ Wonders

Of the 8,000 Realms, 50 are distinguished by the presence of Wonders—unique and magical places of power that confer
special benefits, making them highly desirable playing pieces that may put a target on their owner's back.

In Season 1, Wonder Realms grant a 20% production bonus not only to themselves but also to all Realms and Villages
located within 12 tiles. This bonus means the Wonder Realm itself, the surrounding Realms (up to six), and all Villages
settled around these seven Realms produce food, resources, troops, labor, and donkeys at 120% efficiency compared to
standard Realms, using the same inputs.

Key Notes:

- Production rates are not increased by this bonus, more is produced overall for the same amount of input.
- These bonuses do not stack. There is no benefit to settling multiple wonders in a limited range.

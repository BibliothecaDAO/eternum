## Realms

The 8,000 Realms are the foundation of Eternum, each uniquely destined to shape the fate of this vast continent. As
limited and irreplaceable strongholds, these Realms serve as the primary playing pieces of the game. Each Realm settled
in Eternum can produce between one and seven different resources, depending on the metadata of the original Realm NFT
and its Season Pass.

### Settling

To settle a Realm, Lords must first burn a Season Pass, which gives them the ability to select the location of their
homeland from an array of locations scattered across the map. For Season 1, there is a seven-day settling period before
the game starts, allowing players to organise and position themselves before a move can be made. Realms can still be
settled after this period, however they may be at a disadvantage if spawning near established Realms late in the season.

### Realm Progression

Realms can grow from a Settlement into a City, then to a Kingdom, and finally an Empire. Each upgrade level unlocks
additional buildable hexes and defensive army slots, allowing for the expansion of your economy and strengthening of
your defences. Each progression requires specific materials, outlined in the table below:

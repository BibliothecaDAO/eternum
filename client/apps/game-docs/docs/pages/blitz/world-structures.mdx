# üèóÔ∏è World Structures

All World Structures in Blitz are initially occupied by bandit forces that must be defeated by a player before it can be claimed.

## Hyperstructures

In Blitz, Hyperstructures are **fully constructed** and positioned around the map at the start of the game, ready to be claimed by eliminating resident 
bandit forces. There is no construction process - hyperstructures are immediately functional once claimed and will begin accumulating Score for the
owning player.

The number of Hyperstructures in the game, and their positioning on the world map, is explained in the [World Map](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap) section.

## Essence Rifts

Essence Rifts are striking fissures in the earth where valuable Essence has swelled from beneath the surface. These locations provide a steady source of
the valuable dust to the owning player, reducing the need to explore new hexes for continued Realm expansion and troop production.

## Camps

Camps act in a similar capacity to Villages in Eternum, in the sense that they perform as small, discoverable Realms that can boost production and act as forward bases.
Camps are restricted to the Settlement level and cannot be upgraded.

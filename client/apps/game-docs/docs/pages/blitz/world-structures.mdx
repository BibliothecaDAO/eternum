# üèóÔ∏è World Structures

<span style={{ color: "red" }}>DRAFTING NOTE: Requires review.</span>

World structures in Blitz are pre-built locations scattered across the map that players can claim by eliminating resident bandit forces. There is no construction process - hyperstructures are immediately functional once claimed.

## Hyperstructures

In Blitz, hyperstructures are **fully constructed** and positioned around the map, ready to be claimed by eliminating resident bandit forces. There is no construction process - hyperstructures are immediately functional once claimed.

### Hyperstructure Layout

The map features a strategic layout of hyperstructures:

- **Central Hyperstructure**: Located at the center of the map (A)
- **Ring System**: Hyperstructures are arranged in expanding rings around the center
- **Dynamic Scaling**: As more players join, new rings of hyperstructures are spawned to maintain balance

### Hyperstructure Spawning

The system spawns hyperstructures dynamically based on player count:

- **First Ring (B)**: 6 hyperstructures around the center, supporting 6 players
- **Second Ring (C)**: 18 additional hyperstructures, supporting 18 more players
- **Expanding Rings**: The system continues to add rings as needed for any number of players

### Claiming Hyperstructures

To claim a hyperstructure:

1. **Explore the Map**: Navigate to the hyperstructure location
2. **Defeat Bandits**: Eliminate the resident bandit forces protecting the structure
3. **Establish Control**: Deploy guard armies to maintain control
4. **Earn Points**: Accumulate hyperstructure points for your Objective Score

### Strategic Value

Hyperstructures provide:
- **Objective Score**: Points for claiming and controlling structures
- **Strategic Position**: Key locations for military operations
- **Resource Production**: Some hyperstructures may provide resource bonuses
- **Defensive Positions**: Strong defensive locations on the map

## Camps

Camps are discoverable locations scattered throughout the Blitz world map that provide significant strategic advantages.

### Camp Features

- **Initial Occupation**: Initially occupied by weak to moderate bandit forces
- **Village-like Functionality**: Act similarly to villages with randomized buildings on spawn
- **Resource Storage**: Contain randomized amounts of donkeys, labor, essence, and resources
- **Production Bonus**: Provide resource and military production bonuses when claimed

### Camp Benefits

When claimed, camps offer:
- **Resource Production**: Additional production capacity for the controlling player
- **Military Support**: Enhanced military production capabilities
- **Strategic Position**: Forward operating bases for military operations
- **Resource Boost**: Immediate access to stored resources

### Claiming Camps

To claim a camp:
1. **Discover Location**: Explore to find the camp
2. **Defeat Defenders**: Eliminate the bandit forces
3. **Establish Control**: Deploy guard armies for protection
4. **Utilize Benefits**: Access the camp's production and resource capabilities

## Essence Wells

Essence Wells are specialized structures that provide a steady supply of Essence, the key resource in Blitz.

### Essence Well Functionality

- **Steady Production**: Produce a continuous supply of Essence to the controlling player
- **Resource Independence**: Supplant the need to continue exploring for more Essence
- **Weak Protection**: Protected by bandit forces that must be defeated
- **Strategic Value**: Key resource production points on the map

### Essence Production

Essence Wells provide:
- **Continuous Supply**: Steady Essence production without additional exploration
- **Resource Efficiency**: More efficient than manual exploration for Essence gathering
- **Strategic Control**: Important locations to control for resource dominance

### Claiming Essence Wells

To claim an Essence Well:
1. **Locate the Well**: Explore to find the Essence Well
2. **Defeat Bandits**: Eliminate the protecting bandit forces
3. **Establish Control**: Deploy guard armies for protection
4. **Harvest Essence**: Begin receiving steady Essence production

## Map Exploration Rewards

When exploring the Blitz world map, players can discover:

### Essence Discovery
- **Primary Resource**: Essence is the main resource found during exploration
- **Key Material**: Required for upgrading Realms and constructing military buildings/producing troops

### Additional Discoveries
- **Small Stacks**: Donkeys, T1 troops, and labor to boost capabilities
- **Rare Relics**: Powerful relics (rare) found when exploring or in Camp inventories
- **Consumables**: Items that can be used by armies (e.g., stamina and damage boosters)

### Exploration Mechanics
- **Inventory Capture**: All items found by exploring armies are captured within their inventories
- **Transport Required**: Items must be transported back to a Realm for use (except consumables)
- **No Resource Discovery**: Players no longer find traditional resources when exploring (non-bridgeable)

## Strategic Considerations

### Hyperstructure Control
- **Early Claiming**: Claim hyperstructures quickly to maximize Objective Score
- **Defensive Positioning**: Use hyperstructures as defensive strongholds
- **Military Coordination**: Coordinate attacks to capture enemy-controlled hyperstructures

### Camp Utilization
- **Resource Expansion**: Use camps to expand your resource production capacity
- **Forward Bases**: Establish camps as forward operating bases for military operations
- **Resource Boost**: Leverage camp resources for immediate military or economic advantage

### Essence Well Management
- **Resource Security**: Control Essence Wells to ensure steady Essence supply
- **Production Optimization**: Use Essence Wells to optimize your production efficiency
- **Strategic Defense**: Defend Essence Wells as critical resource production points

### Exploration Strategy
- **Balanced Approach**: Balance exploration with military and economic development
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently transport discovered resources back to your Realms
- **Relic Utilization**: Use discovered relics strategically for maximum advantage

Remember, in Blitz every world structure provides opportunities to increase your Total Score across all three scoring categories: Economy, Military, and Objective!

# 🏗️ World Structures

All World Structures in Blitz are initially occupied by bandit forces that must be defeated by a player before it can be
claimed. Bandit garrisons range from **800 to 1,600 troops**.

## Hyperstructures

In Blitz, Hyperstructures are **fully constructed** and positioned around the map at the start of the game, ready to be
claimed by eliminating the resident bandit forces. There is no construction process - Hyperstructures are immediately
functional once claimed and will begin accumulating Victory Points for the owning player.

The number of Hyperstructures in the game, and their positioning on the world map, is explained in the
[World Map](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap) section.

## Essence Rifts

Essence Rifts are striking fissures in the earth where valuable Essence has swelled from beneath the surface. These
locations provide a steady source of the valuable dust to the owning player, reducing the need to explore new hexes for
continued Realm expansion and troop production. Essence Rifts produce Essence at a rate of 10 units per second from the
moment they're discovered, up to a maximum of **72,000 units**. This covers the full 2-hour match. Lords have a 1/50
chance of finding one of these structures when exploring a hex.

## Camps

Camps act in a similar capacity to Villages in Eternum, in the sense that they perform as small, discoverable Realms
that can boost production and act as forward bases. Camps are restricted to the Settlement level and cannot be upgraded.
Lords have a 1/30 chance of finding one of these structures when exploring a hex.

### Starting Materials

When a camp is claimed, it spawns with an initial stockpile of materials.

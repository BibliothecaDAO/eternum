# üõ°Ô∏è Troop Tiers

Troops come in three distinct tiers: T1, T2, and T3. Tier 1 (T1) represents basic troops, while T2 and T3
troops are more advanced, offering significantly increased combat strength and stamina.

T1 troops have the lowest cost and can be produced in simple mode. Higher-tier troops require rare resources, essence and lower-tier troops
as inputs:

- Two T1 troops combine to produce one T2 troop
- Two T2 troops combine to produce one T3 troop

Each troop tier provides escalating advantages in terms of damage output and stamina.

## Damage Overview

Damage is defined as the number of casualties dealt by one army against the other in an instance of combat. When combat
is initiated (i.e. one army attacks another), damage for both the attacking and defending army is calculated based on
the number of troops, troop tier, stamina, and biome bonuses. Damage is then simultaneously inflicted by both sides.
Battles can last multiple rounds (requiring multiple combat instances) depending on the relative strength and number of
troops involved. Armies with higher-tier troops deal significantly more damage. However, careful management of troop
numbers, stamina, and biome positioning can enable lower-tier armies to overcome stronger opponents.

# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Raiding

## Raiding Mechanics

Raiding allows armies to attempt to steal resources from structures without defeating all defenders. This provides an alternative to full conquest and can be an effective strategy for resource acquisition.

## Raiding Process

### Target Selection
- **Undefended Structures**: Can be raided without casualties
- **Defended Structures**: Raiding success depends on relative army strength
- **Resource-Rich Targets**: Focus on structures with valuable resources

### Raiding Calculation
Raiding success is determined by comparing the raiding army's damage to the combined guard armies:

- **High Success**: Raiding army significantly stronger than defenders
- **Moderate Success**: Raiding army moderately stronger than defenders
- **Low Success**: Raiding army weaker than defenders
- **Failure**: Raiding army much weaker than defenders

## Blitz-Specific Raiding

### No P2P Raiding
- **No Player Raiding**: Players cannot raid other players' Realms
- **Structure Focus**: Raiding limited to world structures (hyperstructures, camps, essence wells)
- **Bandit Protection**: Raiding primarily used against bandit-protected structures

### Resource Acquisition
- **Essence Raiding**: Raid essence wells for immediate Essence gain
- **Camp Resources**: Raid camps for stored resources and materials
- **Strategic Resources**: Target structures with specific resource needs

### Raiding Strategy
- **Early Game**: Use raiding to establish resource base quickly
- **Mid Game**: Raid for specific resources needed for production
- **Late Game**: Focus on securing steady resource production

## Raiding vs. Conquest

### Raiding Advantages
- **Lower Risk**: Less likely to suffer heavy casualties
- **Quick Gains**: Immediate resource acquisition
- **Repeatable**: Can raid the same structure multiple times
- **Resource Focus**: Target specific resources needed

### Conquest Advantages
- **Permanent Control**: Gain permanent control of the structure
- **Steady Production**: Access to ongoing resource production
- **Strategic Position**: Use structure as defensive position
- **Scoring Impact**: Higher scoring contribution

## Strategic Considerations

### Risk Assessment
- **Army Strength**: Evaluate relative strength before raiding
- **Resource Value**: Assess if potential gains justify the risk
- **Timing**: Choose optimal moments for raiding operations
- **Recovery**: Plan for potential losses and recovery

### Target Priority
- **Essence Wells**: High priority for steady Essence production
- **Camps**: Good for immediate resource boost
- **Hyperstructures**: Focus on conquest rather than raiding
- **Resource Needs**: Target structures with resources you need

### Operational Planning
- **Multiple Armies**: Use multiple armies for complex raiding operations
- **Timing**: Coordinate raiding with overall game strategy
- **Defense**: Protect your own structures from potential raids
- **Scoring**: Balance raiding with other scoring opportunities

## Scoring Impact

Raiding contributes to your Military Score:

- **Successful Raids**: Points for successful resource acquisition
- **Resource Efficiency**: Points for efficient resource gathering
- **Strategic Operations**: Points for well-executed raiding campaigns
- **Risk Management**: Points for successful risk-reward decisions

## Golden Token Benefits

Golden Token holders maintain their benefits in raiding operations:

- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Better raiding success rates
- **Resource Efficiency**: More efficient resource acquisition
- **Strategic Advantages**: Better positioning for raiding operations

Remember, in Blitz raiding is a tool for resource acquisition and strategic advantage. Use it wisely to maximize your Total Score and competitive performance!

## Raid Requirements

Before attempting a raid, your army must meet the following requirements:

- Have at least **{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.stamina.staminaAttackReq}** stamina
- Be adjacent to the target structure
- Structure must contain raidable resources

## Raidable Materials

Raidable materials are stolen based on rarity, with the most valuable taken first. Rarer materials are prioritized
during raids:

  <h3 style={importantNote.title}>‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE</h3>
  <p style={importantNote.content}>No materials are safe from pillagers, $LORDS tokens can be raided as well</p>
</div>

## Raid Success

The success chance of a raid is determined by the following conditions:

| Condition                                                                  | Raid Success Chance                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Raiding army's total damage < **50%** of combined guard armies' damage     | **0%**                                        |
| Raiding army's total damage > **200%** of combined guard armies' damage    | **100%**                                      |
| Raiding army's damage between **50%** and **200%** of guard armies' damage | Scales proportionally from **0%** to **100%** |
| No guard armies present                                                    | **100%** (automatic success)                  |

Upon a successful raid, resources are transferred directly to the raiding army's inventory up to its carrying capacity.
It is only possible to steal food, resources, and ancient fragments from a raid, tokens such as $LORDS and $STRK can
only be stolen from another player by claiming a Realm into which tokens have been bridged or transferred.

## Damage in Raids

At the conclusion of a raid, regardless of whether it was successful or not, damage is calculated for both the raiding
army and the guard armies. This damage is significantly reduced by a raid damage modifier, simulating the concept of a
pillaging and looting event as opposed to a full-scale battle. The raid damage modifier reduces damage to
**{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.damage.damageRaidPercentNum/100}%** of that which would be applied in an attack action.

Damage from a raiding action is calculated according to the following rules:

- The raiding army troop total is split evenly across each guard army.
- A standard combat damage calculation is then applied to each combat instance.
- Each damage number is multiplied by the raid damage modifier before casualties are applied.

### Example:

Consider **1000** raiders attacking a structure with two occupied guard slots:

- Slot 1: **400** troops
- Slot 2: **600** troops

The raiding army is split into two groups of **500** troops, each attacking one guard slot. Assume that the damage
calculations result in the following:

- Raiding army deals **180** damage to Slot 1 and **150** damage to Slot 2 = **330** total damage
- Guard armies deal **120** damage from Slot 1 and **200** damage from Slot 2 = **320** total damage.

Applying the raid damage modifier, actual losses become:

- Guards: Slot 1 loses **36** troops (**{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.damage.damageRaidPercentNum/100}%** of 180), Slot 2
  loses **30** troops (**{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.damage.damageRaidPercentNum/100}%** of 150).
- Raiders: Lose **64** troops total (**{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.damage.damageRaidPercentNum/100}%** of 320).

## Raid Outcomes

After a raid attempt, one of two outcomes will occur:

1. **Successful Raid**

   - Resources are transferred to your army's inventory
   - Resources are limited by your army's carrying capacity
   - Both armies suffer reduced casualties (**{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.damage.damageRaidPercentNum/100}%** of normal
     combat damage)
   - Your army's stamina is reduced by **{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.stamina.staminaAttackReq}**

2. **Failed Raid**
   - No resources are stolen
   - Both armies still suffer reduced casualties (**{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.damage.damageRaidPercentNum/100}%** of
     normal combat damage)
   - Your army's stamina is still reduced by **{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.stamina.staminaAttackReq}**

The outcome is determined by comparing your army's total damage output against the combined damage output of all guard
armies present. If no guard armies are present, the raid automatically succeeds.

# ⚔️ Armies

Individual armies consist of a single troop type and tier. Each hex can host only one army, so Lords must carefully
manage their positioning and engagement opportunities.

## Army Strength and Deployment

Blitz uses a strength-based deployment system that determines how many troops can be deployed based on Realm level and
troop tier.

### Army Strength Calculation

Army strength is calculated as: **Army_Strength = Troop_Amount × Tier_Strength**

Where Tier Strength values are:
- **T1**: 1
- **T2**: 3
- **T3**: 9

### Deployment Caps

Each Realm level has a maximum deployment cap that limits the total army strength that can be deployed:

| Realm Level | Deployment Cap |
|-------------|----------------|
| Settlement  | 3,000          |
| City        | 15,000         |
| Kingdom     | 45,000         |
| Empire      | 90,000         |

### Maximum Army Size

The maximum number of troops in a single army depends on both the deployment cap and the troop tier, calculated as:

**Max_Army_Size = (Deployment_Cap / Tier_Strength) × Tier_Modifier**

Where Tier Modifiers are:
- **T1**: 0.5
- **T2**: 1.0
- **T3**: 1.5

**Examples:**
- A Kingdom (45,000 cap) deploying T2 troops: (45,000 / 3) × 1.0 = **15,000 T2 troops** per army
- A City (15,000 cap) deploying T3 troops: (15,000 / 9) × 1.5 = **2,500 T3 troops** per army
- An Empire (90,000 cap) deploying T1 troops: (90,000 / 1) × 0.5 = **45,000 T1 troops** per army

### Army Slots

The number of field and guard army slots depends on the Realm level:

| Realm Level | Field Army Slots | Guard Army Slots |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Settlement  | 1                | 1                |
| City        | 3                | 2                |
| Kingdom     | 5                | 3                |
| Empire      | 8                | 4                |

Lords can deploy armies from the Military tab in the Local view.

## Field Armies

Field armies are used to project force on the world map, explore unknown territories, claim hyperstructures, defeat
bandit forces, and engage in combat with other players. These armies are deployed onto one of the six hexes surrounding
their parent Realm on the world map. If all hexes adjacent to the Realm are occupied, a field army cannot be deployed.
Once deployed, these armies occupy a hex and traverse the world map based on the conditions outlined in the
[World Map & Movement](/blitz/worldmap-movement/movement) section.

Field armies are tied to the Realm or Camp that created them. They can only merge with field armies from the same
structure, and can only transfer into guard slots of their own structure. Guard armies can only transfer back into field
armies from the same structure.

Lords may direct their field armies to attack another army or structure on any adjacent hex by selecting the army with
left-click, then right-clicking the target hex. When attacking a structure, the field army will engage in combat against
any guard armies present.

## Guard Armies

Guard armies do not appear on the world map; instead, they occupy defense slots visible in the Military tab of the Local
view. When in the World view, Lords can observe the defensive capabilities of any structure by selecting a hex and
opening up the Details tab.

When attacked, guard armies are targeted sequentially starting from the outermost occupied slot. If a guard army is
destroyed, the slot that it occupied becomes unavailable for reinforcement for **10 minutes**. Once all guard armies are
defeated, the structure becomes vulnerable to being claimed by an adjacent field army. Lords can also direct their guard
armies to launch attacks against enemy field armies on adjacent hexes by selecting their structure on the world map,
then right-clicking the target hex.

## World Structure Deployment

World Structures (Camps, Essence Rifts, and Hyperstructures) can only have guard armies deployed to them—field armies
cannot be created from these structures.

- **Camps & Essence Rifts**: Use Settlement-level deployment caps and army slots (1 guard slot)
- **Hyperstructures**: Use Empire-level deployment caps and army slots (4 guard slots)

# ⚔️ Armies

Individual armies consist of a single troop type and tier. Each hex can host only one army, so Lords must carefully
manage their positioning and engagement opportunities.

Each Realm has a limited number of guard and field armies. The number of armies can be increased by upgrading the Realm
level as explained in the [Realms](/blitz/realms/realm) section. Each military building constructed also increases total
field armies by 1 (up to a maximum of **+{ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.limit.explorerMaxPartyCount-4}**). Lords can deploy
armies from the Military tab in the Local view. The maximum size of an army is
**{formatNumberWithCommas(ETERNUM_CONFIG().troop.limit.explorerAndGuardMaxTroopCount)}**.

## Field Armies

Field armies are used to project force on the world map, explore unknown territories, claim hyperstructures, defeat
bandit forces, and engage in combat with other players. These armies are deployed onto one of the six hexes surrounding
their parent Realm on the world map. If all hexes adjacent to the Realm are occupied, a field army cannot be deployed.
Once deployed, these armies occupy a hex and traverse the world map based on the conditions outlined in the
[World Map & Movement](/blitz/worldmap-movement/movement) section.

Lords may direct their field armies to attack another army or structure on any adjacent hex by selecting the army with
left-click, then right-clicking the target hex. When attacking a structure, the field army will engage in combat against
any guard armies present.

## Guard Armies

Guard armies do not appear on the world map; instead, they occupy defense slots visible in the Military tab of the Local
view. When in the World view, Lords can observe the defensive capabilities of any structure by selecting a hex and
opening up the Details tab.

Unlike Realms, World Structures have a static number of defense slots:

</div>

When attacked, guard armies are targeted sequentially starting from the outermost occupied slot. If a guard army is
destroyed, the slot that it occupied becomes unavailable for reinforcement for **10 minutes**. Once all guard armies are
defeated, the structure becomes vulnerable to being claimed by an adjacent field army. Lords can also direct their guard
armies to launch attacks against adjacent hexes by selecting their structure on the worldmap, then right-clicking the
target hex.

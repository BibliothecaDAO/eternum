# 📈 Blitz MMR

Blitz MMR (Matchmaking Rating) is an onchain skill rating that tracks player performance across rated Blitz games. It is
enabled on a per-world basis; if a world has MMR disabled, no ratings are tracked.

## What MMR Measures

MMR is a **persistent rating** intended to reflect long-term performance rather than a single match outcome. After a
game ends, the system updates each eligible player’s MMR based on:

- Your **final rank** in the match
- Your **expected performance** relative to the lobby’s median MMR
- Lobby size scaling (larger lobbies produce more stable deltas)

## Eligibility (Who Gets Rated)

Only players who are:

- **Registered** in the match, and
- Have **non-zero recorded points**

are included in the rated update.

## How the Update Is Calculated (High Level)

Blitz uses a percentile-based update that compares:

- **Expected percentile** (from a logistic curve around the lobby median), vs.
- **Actual percentile** (from your finishing rank)

The resulting delta is capped (diminishing returns) and includes a small mean-regression term toward the configured
distribution mean.

> Implementation note: the onchain calculator follows an 8-step formula including median MMR, expected/actual
> percentile, capped delta, split-lobby adjustment, and mean regression.

## Claim / Update Flow (Commit + Claim)

MMR updates are applied after the match completes via a single action in the client:

1. **Finalize ranking** for the match (MMR cannot update until final ranking exists).
2. Open **Social → MMR**.
3. Click **Update MMR**.

When you click Update MMR, the client:

- Fetches current MMR values for eligible players from the MMR token contract
- Sorts players by current MMR (lowest → highest) as required by the commit call
- Submits a single onchain transaction to commit the game’s MMR update and apply new ratings

Once committed, the update cannot be run again for that match.

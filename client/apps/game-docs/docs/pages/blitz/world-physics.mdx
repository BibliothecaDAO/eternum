# 🌪️ World Physics

In Blitz, every action is governed by onchain physics—immutable rules encoded directly onto the blockchain, ensuring
fairness, transparency, and absolute consistency for all Lords. Here, code is law; no exceptions exist outside the
boundaries set by these protocols.

## Game Duration

Each Blitz game runs for exactly **2 hours**.

## Time

Time within a Blitz game is measured in Eternum Days, and each is precisely 5 minutes in length. One day ends and the next
begins every 5 minutes, so a single Blitz game takes place over 24 Eternum Days.

## Materials

In Blitz, materials such as food, resources, troops and donkeys are isolated within each round. There is no bridging of materials in and out of the game (other than 
relics, which can be bridged in prior to the start of the game). All materials have an associated weight, which determines the amount that can be stored and the 
number of donkeys required to move the goods from place to place.

Note: This document will use 'materials' to refer to all tangible assets - i.e. food, resources, essence, 
labor, troops, and donkeys. This is not to be confused with 'resources', which specifically refers to the 9 resources in Blitz.

## Cost of Production

With the exception of food, nothing in Blitz is produced for free; every unit of production demands an input—food,
labor, resources, or some combination thereof. Lords must consider these costs and effectively balance production to ensure
they can maximize their score within the 2-hour game window.

## Travel

Transporting materials takes time and donkeys. Every transfer of materials between
locations relies exclusively on these speedy and dependable creatures. Donkeys are single-use, consumed upon
completing their journey, making continuous acquisition vital for maintaining supply chains.

Troops can also be moved between Realms using donkeys, but to dominate your enemies and ensure security of your
lands, troops must be deployed to an army on the world map. Once troops are deployed, they cannot be taken back into the inventory. 
Their mobility is then governed by stamina, limiting the distance they can travel and the number of actions they can perform. 
Travelling between hexes or initiating an attack expends valuable stamina points, which are partially replensished each Eternum Day.

## Hexes

Blitz unfolds across a procedurally-generated, hexagonal-tile world map. This represents the physical space
of the world and defines spawn locations, biome distribution, and distances between Realms and other world
structures. This is the layer in which armies explore, fight, and capture, and is explorable in the 'World' view.

Zooming in, each Realm hex is broken up into smaller hexes which define the local area and building placement. 
Here in the 'Local' view, Lords can plan out their building placement and closely manage their
population, supply chain, and production.

## Biomes

Each hexagonal tile on the world map possesses a distinct biome. Each troop type responds uniquely to these varied
terrains, gaining or losing combat efficiency and stamina based on their affinity with different biomes. Successful
Lords must master biome knowledge to exploit strategic advantages or avoid costly missteps.

## The Blitz Arena

The map on which Blitz takes place is designed to position Lords as equally as possible while also providing a dynamic
battlefield that scales appropriately. Each player starts the game with three Realms, evenly spaced apart in a triangle 
and positioned between three complete and revealed Hyperstructures. Player Realms and Hyperstructures are placed in a 
specific pattern to ensure that all Lords have a comparable number of neighbors and equal access to Hyperstructures. 

The primary objective of Blitz is to capture and hold as many Hyperstructures and World Structures as possible to accumulate 
Score and secure a position at the top of the leaderboard.

In Blitz, every action is governed by onchain physics‚Äîimmutable rules encoded directly onto the blockchain, ensuring
fairness, transparency, and absolute consistency for all Lords. Here, code is law; no exceptions exist outside the
boundaries set by these protocols.

## Game Duration

Each Blitz game runs for exactly **2 hours**. Eternum Days are reduced to 5 minutes each, resulting in 24 Eternum Days total per game.

## Time

Time within a Blitz game is measured in Eternum Days, and each is precisely 5 minutes in length. One day ends and the next
begins every 5 minutes.

## Materials

In Blitz, materials such as food, resources, troops and donkeys are isolated within each round. There is no bridging of materials in and out of the game (other than relics).
All materials have an associated weight, which determines the amount that can be stored and the number of donkeys required to move the goods from place to place.

Note: This document will use 'materials' to refer to all tangible assets - i.e. food, resources, essence, 
labor, troops, and donkeys. This is not to be confused with 'resources', which specifically refers to the 9 resources in Blitz.

## Cost of Production

With the exception of food, nothing in Blitz is produced for free; every unit of production demands an input‚Äîfood,
labor, resources, or some combination thereof. Lords must consider these costs and effectively balance production to ensure
they can maximize their score within the 2-hour game window.

## Travel

Transporting materials takes time‚Ä¶ and donkeys. Every transfer of materials between
locations relies exclusively on these speedy and dependable creatures. These donkeys are single-use, consumed upon
completing their journey, making continuous acquisition vital for maintaining supply chains and strategic flexibility.

Troops can also be moved between Realms using donkeys, but to dominate your enemies and ensure security of your
lands, troops must be deployed to an army. Once troops are deployed, they cannot be taken back into the inventory.
Once troops are deployed to the world map, their mobility is governed by stamina, 
limiting the distance they can travel and the number of actions they can perform. Travelling between hexes or initiating
an attack expends valuable stamina points, which are partially replensished each Eternum Day.

## Hexes

Blitz unfolds across a procedurally-generated, hexagonal-tile world map. This represents the physical space
of the world and defines spawn locations, biome distribution, and distances between Realms and other world
structures. This is the layer in which armies explore, fight, raid and capture, and is explorable in the 'World' view.

Zooming in, each Realm hex is broken up into smaller hexes which define the local area and building placement
(hexes within hexes!). Here in the 'Local' view, Lords can plan out their building placement and closely manage their
population, supply chain, and production.

## Biomes

Each hexagonal tile on the world map possesses a distinct biome. Each troop type responds uniquely to these varied
terrains, gaining or losing combat efficiency and stamina based on their affinity with different biomes. Successful
Lords must master biome knowledge to exploit strategic advantages or avoid costly missteps.

## The Blitz Arena

Initial scouting reports have revealed some key details about the Blitz world:

- **Hyperstructures** are fully constructed and positioned around the map in strategic rings. These are rare, key
  locations that must be claimed by Lords by defeating resident bandit forces. They are more likely to be found in the central regions of the map, and as each subsequent Hyperstructure
  is discovered, the likelihood of finding another one in the world diminishes.

- **Camps** are scattered across the landscape, initially occupied by weak to moderate bandit forces. These act similarly to villages and contain randomized buildings on spawn, providing resource and military production bonuses when claimed.

- **Essence Wells** are specialized structures that produce a steady supply of Essence, the key resource in Blitz. These are weakly protected by bandits and provide continuous Essence production to the controlling player.

- **Bandits** roam throughout the lands and have established lairs in each of the key locations described above. The newly
  arrived Lords will need to overcome these lawless brigands to bring order and control back to the world.

The Blitz map features a strategic layout designed for balanced competition:

- **Central Hyperstructure**: Located at the center of the map
- **Ring System**: Hyperstructures are arranged in expanding rings around the center
- **Dynamic Scaling**: As more players join, new rings of hyperstructures are spawned to maintain balance
- **Player Spawning**: Each player starts with three Realms, evenly spaced apart in a triangle
- **Balanced Distribution**: The system ensures each player has equal access to hyperstructures

# 📜 Transfers

Blitz has no trade system. Blitz focuses on individual competitive performance without economic trading mechanics. As
such, there are no Banks, no P2P transfers, and no AMM or Orderbook through which Lords may trade.

## Transferring Materials

Throughout the game, Lords may face the need to transfer materials from place to place around the world map, whether it
be to their own Realms or other structures like Hyperstructures, Essence Rifts, and Camps. Lords have two primary
options for initiating transfers:

- **Detailed Transfer**: Players can use the comprehensive transfer menu accessible from the Trade tab. This allows
  transfers of multiple types of materials simultaneously to any structure on the map.

- **Quick Transfer**: Alternatively, Lords can swiftly transfer resources between their own structures using the
  resources sidebar, ideal for managing internal logistics and maintaining supply chains.

## The Donkey Network

When a transfer is initiated, donkeys travel through the invisible and immutable donkey network. This is the key
infrastructure upon which all material transport takes place. One donkey is capable of carrying up to **50 kg** of
materials, so the number of donkeys required for a transfer depends on the total weight of the materials being moved.
Once a transfer is initiated, it cannot be canceled, and the journey will take some time depending on the distance to
the destination structure. Upon arrival, transferred materials and donkeys must be manually claimed via the 'Resource
Arrivals' tab before they become available for use.

### Material Weights

Materials have different weights that affect transportation:

### Blitz Restrictions

While troops can be transferred between Realms as normal, donkeys cannot be used to transport troops between Realms and
Hyperstructures, Essence Rifts, or Camps. This is to reduce the defensive advantage that a player can leverage by being
able to move troops quickly into guard armies on these structures once claimed. All players must therefore deploy armies
from Realms and move them across the map to contest these critical points.

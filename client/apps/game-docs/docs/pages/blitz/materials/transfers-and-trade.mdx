# 📜 Transfers

Blitz has no trade system. Blitz focuses on individual competitive performance without economic trading mechanics. As
such, there are no Banks, no P2P transfers, and no AMM or Orderbook through which Lords may trade.

## Transferring Materials

Throughout the game, Lords may face the need to transfer materials from place to place around the world map, whether it
be to their own Realms or other structures like Hyperstructures, Essence Rifts, and Camps. Lords have two primary
options for initiating transfers:

- **Detailed Transfer**: Players can use the comprehensive transfer panel accessible from the right side navigation
  menu. This allows transfers of multiple types of materials simultaneously to any structure on the map.

Players can choose to do one off shipments or repeat them on a schedule through automation (transfers can be repeated
every 1-30min). To manage scheduled transfers, you can click on the advanced button of the transfer panel. From there
you'll be able to force a new run, pause/resume or delete the transfer automations.

- **Quick Transfer**: Alternatively, Lords can swiftly transfer resources between their own structures using the
  resources sidebar, ideal for managing internal logistics and maintaining supply chains.

## The Donkey Network

When a transfer is initiated, donkeys travel through the invisible and immutable donkey network. This is the key
infrastructure upon which all material transport takes place. One donkey is capable of carrying up to **50 kg** of
materials, so the number of donkeys required for a transfer depends on the total weight of the materials being moved.
Once a transfer is initiated, it cannot be canceled, and the journey will take some time depending on the distance to
the destination structure. You can check the 'Resource Arrivals' tab to follow your shipments.

Upon arrival, transferred resources are now automatically claimed :

### Material Weights

Materials have different weights that affect transportation:

### Blitz Restrictions

Troops can be transferred by donkey between any structures owned by the same player, including Realms, Camps, Essence
Rifts, and Hyperstructures.

If a structure is captured, any troops stored in that structure or in transit to it are destroyed. This prevents
capture handoffs from being used to move troops farther or faster than intended. Deployed armies still become owned by
the new structure owner.

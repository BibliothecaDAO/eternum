# 🧱 Materials

## Materials Overview

Materials encompass all transportable assets in Blitz, including:

- **Resources**: 9 distinct resource types that can be produced on Realms.
- **Food**: Essential Wheat that fuels production and troop movement.
- **Troops**: Military units (Knights, Crossbowmen, Paladins) that can be assigned to armies.
- **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport units required for moving materials across the world.
- **Labor**: A special material that enables construction and production.
- **Essence**: A new strategic resource found through exploration and required for building, production, and upgrades.

While all materials can be transported within the game, **no materials can be bridged out** of Blitz.

## Material Categories

### Resources

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Wood" id={ResourcesIds.Wood} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Coal" id={ResourcesIds.Coal} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Copper" id={ResourcesIds.Copper} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Ironwood" id={ResourcesIds.Ironwood} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Cold Iron" id={ResourcesIds.ColdIron} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Gold" id={ResourcesIds.Gold} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Adamantine" id={ResourcesIds.Adamantine} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Mithral" id={ResourcesIds.Mithral} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Dragonhide" id={ResourcesIds.Dragonhide} />
</div>

Resources are the foundation of the economy. The 9 resources play vital roles in Blitz, from basic production to
advanced military operations.

### Food

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Wheat" id={ResourcesIds.Wheat} />
</div>

Food is the cornerstone of a Realm's economy and is required in all production chains. Only Wheat is available in Blitz
and it can be produced without inputs.

### Troops

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Knight" id={ResourcesIds.Knight} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Crossbowman" id={ResourcesIds.Crossbowman} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Paladin" id={ResourcesIds.Paladin} />
</div>

Troops are required to defend your holdings and strike out at your foes. When produced, they can be transported between
your structures by donkey like any other material, but to be used they must be deployed to an army. Once deployed, they
cannot be converted back into material form.

### Donkeys

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Donkey" id={ResourcesIds.Donkey} />
</div>

Donkeys are essential for moving materials between your structures. They only require a market and wheat to produce, but
are consumed after a single journey.

### Labor

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Labor" id={ResourcesIds.Labor} />
</div>

Labor is a key component in the construction of all buildings and required for 'simple mode' production. In Blitz, it is
produced freely in the Keep of each Realm.

### Essence

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Essence" id={ResourcesIds.Essence} />
</div>

Essence is a new material that can only be found by exploring the map and interacting with World Structures. It is
required in all Realm upgrades, as well as for some building construction and production of high-tier troops.

# ðŸªµ Materials

## Materials Overview

Materials encompass all transportable assets in Blitz, including:

- **Food**: Essential wheat that fuels production and troop movement
- **Resources**: 9 distinct resource types that can be produced on Realms
- **Troops**: Military units (Knights, Crossbowmen, Paladins) that can be assigned to armies
- **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport units required for moving materials across the world
- **Labor**: A special material that enables construction and production
- **Essence**: A new strategic resource found through exploration and required for upgrades

While all materials can be transported within the game, **no materials can be bridged out** of Blitz. Players may only
bridge relics into the game.

## Resources

Resources are the foundation of **Blitz**'s economy. The 9 simplified resources play vital roles in the game's
ecosystem, from basic production to advanced military operations.

## Material Categories

### Basic Materials

#### Food

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Wheat" id={ResourcesIds.Wheat} />
</div>

Food is the cornerstone of your realm's economy:

- **Simplified System**: Only Wheat is available (no Fish)
- **Basic Production**: Produced without additional resource inputs
- **Essential Resource**: Required for most production chains
- **Troop Maintenance**: Essential for maintaining troops and construction

### Strategic Materials

#### Military

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Knight" id={ResourcesIds.Knight} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Crossbowman" id={ResourcesIds.Crossbowman} />
  <ResourceIcon name="Paladin" id={ResourcesIds.Paladin} />
</div>

Military units have unique properties:

- **Deployment Only**: Cannot be converted back to tradeable form once deployed to an army
- **Army Transfer**: Can be transferred between armies if located on adjacent hexes and of the same type and tier
- **Essence Requirement**: All troop production requires Essence

<div style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0", borderTop: "1px solid #4d3923" }}></div>

#### Transport (Donkeys)

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Donkey" id={ResourcesIds.Donkey} />
</div>

Essential for logistics:

- **Food Cost Only**: Donkeys only cost food to produce (no $LORDS cost)
- **Single Use**: Consumed after a single journey
- **Required Transport**: Essential for moving materials around the world

<div style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0", borderTop: "1px solid #4d3923" }}></div>

### Special Materials

#### **$LORDS** Currency

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Lords" id={ResourcesIds.Lords} size="xl" />
</div>

**$LORDS** is Blitz's economic backbone:

- **Entry Fees**: Used for Warrior bracket entry fees
- **Prize Pools**: Distributed as prizes to top performers
- **No Donkey Production**: Not required for donkey production in Blitz

#### Labor

<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "baseline", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
  <ResourceIcon name="Labor" id={ResourcesIds.Labor} />
</div>

Labor is a fundamental production material:

- **Universal Production**: Can be produced by any Realm
- **Construction Required**: Required to construct most buildings
- **Resource Burning**: Produced by burning resources, with rarer resources yielding more labor
- **Essence Integration**: May require Essence for some production

#### Essence

**Essence** is the key strategic resource in Blitz:

- **Exploration Required**: Found by exploring the map and interacting with world structures
- **Upgrade Requirement**: Required for all Realm upgrades and building construction
- **Troop Production**: Essential for producing all troop types
- **Strategic Value**: Control of Essence sources provides competitive advantage
- **No Production**: Cannot be produced, only found through exploration

## Blitz-Specific Mechanics

### No Bridging Out

- **Internal Only**: All materials remain within the Blitz game world
- **No External Trade**: Cannot bridge materials out as ERC20 tokens
- **Relic Bridging**: Players may only bridge relics into the game
- **Scoring Focus**: Materials contribute to scoring rather than external value

### Simplified Resources

- **9 Resources**: Simplified resource system for fast-paced gameplay
- **No Fish**: Food simplified to just Wheat
- **Balanced System**: Resources designed for 3-hour competitive games
- **Strategic Choices**: Choose production based on immediate needs

### Increased Production Rates

- **Faster Production**: All production rates increased for fast-paced gameplay
- **Altered Recipes**: Production and building recipes modified for Blitz balance
- **Efficient Scaling**: Optimized for 3-hour competitive sessions
- **Strategic Timing**: Production timing crucial for competitive success

## Strategic Considerations

### Essence Management

- **Early Acquisition**: Secure Essence sources quickly
- **Exploration Priority**: Focus exploration on Essence discovery
- **Strategic Control**: Control Essence Wells for steady production
- **Upgrade Planning**: Plan upgrades around Essence availability

### Resource Optimization

- **Production Efficiency**: Optimize production for maximum scoring
- **Strategic Building**: Choose buildings based on immediate needs
- **Resource Conversion**: Convert resources to scoring opportunities
- **Balanced Development**: Balance all resource types for maximum efficiency

### Competitive Strategy

- **Early Game**: Establish basic production quickly
- **Mid Game**: Scale up production based on strategic needs
- **Late Game**: Optimize for maximum scoring
- **Resource Control**: Control key resource sources for competitive advantage

Remember, in Blitz's fast-paced environment, efficient resource management is crucial for maximizing your Total Score
and competitive performance!

# üè∫ Relics

Relics are powerful consumables that can be discovered in Blitz from [Relic Crates](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap#relic-crates), or
rewarded for playing Blitz games through Relic Chests. Depending on the nature of a Relic, it can be consumed by an army or a Realm in
exchange for a time-limited bonus, such as a damage or production boost. When utilized at the right time, these items can provide a
strategic edge over your opponents.

_Note: Relics are still under development. Initial versions of Blitz will limit their scope to within the game instance. However,
it is expected that Relics will have a much broader presence and impact in the Realms ecosystem. Keep an eye out for announcements 
in the Realms Discord relating to Relics. This page will be updated as more information is made available to the community._

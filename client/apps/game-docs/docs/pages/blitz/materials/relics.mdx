# üè∫ Relics

Relics are powerful consumables that can be discovered in Blitz from
[Relic Crates](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap#relic-crates), or rewarded for playing Blitz games through [Relic
Chests](/overview/chests/contents#relic-chests). Depending on the nature of a relic, it can be consumed by an army or a 
Realm in exchange for a time-limited bonus, such as a damage or production boost. When utilized at the right time, these 
items can provide a strategic edge over your opponents.

There are currently nine relic types, each with two levels. A level 2 relic is simply a more powerful version of the
level 1 counterpart. Every relic type has a distinct effect, which determines whether it can be activated by a Realm or
an army. To activate a relic and gain the desired effect, the army or Realm must pay an amount of Essence. These
details, as well as the discovery chance of each relic in a Relic Crate, are defined in the table below:

<RelicTable />

Each Relic Crate yields three relics. For every crate, the chances in the table above are rolled three separate times,
so you may receive duplicates in a single crate.

_Note: Relics are still under development. Initial versions of Blitz will limit their scope to within the game instance.
However, it is expected that relics will have a much broader presence and impact in the Realms ecosystem. Keep an eye
out for announcements in the Realms Discord relating to relics. This page will be updated as more information is made
available to the community._

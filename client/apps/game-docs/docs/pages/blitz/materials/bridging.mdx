# ðŸŒ‰ Bridging

Bridging in Blitz is **severely limited**. The focus is on internal competition and scoring rather than external value extraction.

## Bridging Restrictions

### No Material Bridging Out
- **Internal Only**: All materials remain within the Blitz game world
- **No External Trade**: Cannot bridge materials out as ERC20 tokens
- **Scoring Focus**: Materials contribute to scoring rather than external value
- **Competitive Design**: Designed to focus on competitive performance

### Relic Bridging In
- **One-Way Bridging**: Players may only bridge relics into the game
- **Strategic Items**: Relics provide strategic advantages during gameplay
- **No Bridging Out**: Relics cannot be bridged back out
- **Game-Only Value**: Relics have value only within the Blitz game world

## Strategic Implications

### Resource Management
- **Internal Focus**: All resource decisions focus on internal game value
- **Scoring Optimization**: Use resources to maximize Total Score
- **No External Value**: Don't plan for external value extraction
- **Competitive Efficiency**: Optimize resource use for competitive success

### Relic Strategy
- **Strategic Bridging**: Bridge relics that provide competitive advantages
- **Game-Only Planning**: Plan relic use for 3-hour competitive games
- **No Value Preservation**: Don't expect to preserve relic value outside the game
- **Competitive Focus**: Use relics to maximize competitive performance

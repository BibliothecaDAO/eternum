# ðŸŒ‰ Bridging

Bridging in Blitz is limited to the bridging of Relics into the game. This is to prevent players from gaining advantage
through the import of materials previously extracted from Eternum seasons, while still encouraging the use of
consumables for engaging and competitive gameplay. There is no bridging out of Blitz sessions, once relics are bridged
in they cannot be taken out of the session.

## Bridging Relics

_Work in Progress... Initial versions of Blitz will only feature Relics found within 
[Relic Crates](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap#relic-crates). More information on tokenized Relics will be made
available soon_

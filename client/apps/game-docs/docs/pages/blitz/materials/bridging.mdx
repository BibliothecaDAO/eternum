# ðŸŒ‰ Bridging

Bridging in Blitz is limited to the bridging of relics into the game. This is to prevent players from gaining advantage through the 
import of materials previously extracted from Eternum seasons, while still encouraging the use of consumables for engaging and 
competitive gameplay. There is no bridging out of Blitz sessions, once relics are bridged in they cannot be taken out of the session.

# ðŸ¤– Resource Automation

Resource automation allows players to set up continuous production processes and automated transfers within their realms
and between entities. This system helps manage resource generation and distribution efficiently without constant manual
intervention.

## Overview

The automation system works by processing two types of "orders" that you define:

1. **Production Orders**: Automate resource production within your realms
2. **Transfer Orders**: Automate resource transfers between your entities (realms, villages, hyperstructures, etc.)

Both types of orders specify what you want to automate, the method or conditions, target amounts or schedules, and
priorities.

**Key Features:**

- **Order-Based**: Define specific production and transfer tasks.
- **Priority System**: Control the sequence of execution for multiple orders.
- **Multiple Automation Types**: Choose between production automation and transfer automation.
- **Entity-Specific**: Automation is configured on a per-entity basis.
- **Browser Dependent**: Automation processes run in your browser; the game tab must remain open for automation to
  function.

## How It Works

The automation system periodically checks and processes active orders for each entity.

1. **Processing Interval**: All orders are evaluated every 10 minutes.
2. **Order Prioritization**: For each entity, orders are sorted by their priority number (1 being the highest).
3. **Pause Functionality**: You can pause all automation for any entity, which will skip all orders for that entity.
4. **Order Processing**: The system also processes different order types.

### Production Order Processing

- **Balance Check**: Before executing, the system checks if the realm has sufficient input resources or labor.
- **Recipe-Based Production**: Production follows predefined recipes from the game's configuration.
- **Cycle Calculation**: Determines the maximum number of production cycles possible based on available inputs.
- **Transaction**: If conditions are met, a blockchain transaction is initiated to perform the production.

### Transfer Order Processing

- **Schedule Check**: For recurring transfers, checks if enough time has passed since the last transfer.
- **Threshold Check**: For conditional transfers, checks if resource levels meet the specified conditions.
- **Resource Availability**: Verifies the source entity has sufficient resources for the transfer.
- **Transaction**: If conditions are met, initiates a transfer transaction between entities.

## Production Types

There are two types of production automation:

1. **Standard (Resource-to-Resource)**:
   - Converts one or more input resources into a different output resource.
   - Example: Using Wood and Stone to produce Tools.
2. **Simple (Labor-to-Resource)**:
   - Utilizes Labor from the realm to produce a specific resource.
   - Example: Using Labor to harvest Food.

## Production Order Modes

Production orders can operate in two different modes:

1. **Produce Once**:

   - Produces resources until the target amount is reached, then stops.
   - Shows progress as "Produced / Target" (e.g., "1,500 / 5,000").
   - Can be set to "Infinite" to produce continuously without a limit.

2. **Maintain Balance**:
   - Keeps resource balance at the target level.
   - Production triggers when balance drops below target minus buffer percentage.
   - Example: Target 10,000 with 10% buffer = production starts when balance drops below 9,000.
   - Useful for maintaining steady resource levels.

## Transfer Types

Transfer automation allows you to automatically move resources between your entities. There are three transfer modes:

1. **Recurring Transfers**:

   - Transfers resources at regular intervals.
   - Minimum interval: 10 minutes (due to automation cycle).
   - Example: Transfer 1,000 Food from Realm A to Realm B every 2 hours.

2. **Maintain Stock Transfers**:

   - Transfers when the destination entity falls below a threshold.
   - Example: Transfer 500 Wood to Realm B when it has less than 1,000 Wood.
   - Helps keep important entities well-supplied.

3. **Depletion Transfers**:
   - Transfers when the source entity exceeds a threshold.
   - Example: Transfer excess Stone when Realm has more than 5,000 Stone.
   - Prevents resource overflow and distributes surplus.

## Managing Automation Orders (UI)

You can manage automation orders through the "Automation" tab within any entity's interface, or through the global "All
Automations" view.

### Production Automation

Production automation is managed within individual realm interfaces.

#### Adding a New Production Order

1. Click the "Add New Automation" button.
2. Configure the following:
   - **Order Mode**:
     - `Produce Once`: Produce up to target amount then stop
     - `Maintain Balance`: Keep resource balance at target level
   - **Production Type**:
     - `Standard (Resource-based)`
     - `Simple (Labor-based)`
   - **Priority (1-9)**:
     - Set the execution priority. `1` is the highest priority, `9` is the lowest.
   - **Resource to Produce**:
     - Select the resource you want to produce or consume.
     - The UI shows required input resources for Resource-to-Resource recipes.
   - **Target Amount**:
     - For "Produce Once": Set total quantity to produce, or check "Infinite" for continuous production.
     - For "Maintain Balance": Set the balance level to maintain.
   - **Buffer Percentage** (Maintain Balance only):
     - Production starts when balance drops below target minus buffer percentage.
3. Click "Add Automation".

### Transfer Automation

Transfer automation allows you to move resources between any of your entities.

#### Adding a New Transfer Order

1. **Select Source Entity**:
   - Choose entity type (Your Realms, Your Villages, etc.)
   - Search and select the specific source entity
2. **Configure Transfer**:

   - **Transfer Mode**:
     - `Recurring`: Transfer at regular intervals
     - `Maintain Stock`: Transfer when destination is low
     - `Depletion Transfer`: Transfer when source is high
   - **Destination Entity**:
     - Choose entity type and select specific destination
   - **Resources to Transfer**:
     - Add multiple resources with specific amounts
   - **Schedule/Conditions**:
     - For Recurring: Set interval in minutes (minimum 10 minutes)
     - For conditional transfers: Set threshold amounts

3. Click "Add Transfer Automation".

#### Transfer Interval Guidelines

- **Minimum Interval**: TBC (matches automation processing cycle)
- **Custom Intervals**: Custom intervals can be set in minutes
- **Effective Timing**: Transfers occur when automation cycles align with your interval

### Viewing and Managing Orders

#### Individual Entity View

Each entity shows its automation orders in a table with:

- **Priority**: Order execution priority
- **Mode**: "Once", "Maintain", or transfer mode ("Recurring", "Stock", "Depletion")
- **Resource**: Visual representation of resource flow
- **Target/Balance**: Target amounts or transfer schedules
- **Produced**: Amount produced (production orders only)
- **Type**: Order type (production or transfer)
- **Actions**: Remove button

#### Global Automation View

The "All Automations" view shows orders from all entities:

- **Realm Filter**: Filter by specific realm or view all
- **Order Status**: Visual indicators for completed, paused, or active orders
- **Countdown Timer**: Shows time until next automation cycle
- **Bulk Actions**: Pause/resume or delete orders

### Pausing Automation

You can pause automation at different levels:

1. **Individual Entity**: Pause all automation for a specific entity
2. **Individual Order**: Remove specific orders
3. **Global Control**: Manage all orders from the global view

## Important Considerations

### General Requirements

- **Browser Must Be Open**: Automation processing occurs in your browser. If you close the game tab or your browser,
  automated processes will stop.
- **10-Minute Processing Cycle**: All automation is processed every 10 minutes. This affects timing for all orders.
- **Transaction Costs**: Each successful automation cycle that results in production or transfer will involve a
  blockchain transaction, which incurs network transaction fees.
- **Processing Time**: Due to the 10-minute processing interval and potential network conditions, there might be a delay
  before an order is executed or its results are visible.

### Production Automation Considerations

- **Resource Availability**: Production orders will only execute if the required input resources are available in the
  realm at the time of processing.
- **Recipe Dependencies**: Production follows predefined game recipes. You cannot produce resources that don't have
  valid recipes.
- **Storage Limits**: Produced resources will increase your realm's balance and may cause resource loss if storage is
  full.

### Transfer Automation Considerations

- **Entity Ownership**: You can only set up transfers between entities you own.
- **Transfer Timing**:
  - Minimum effective interval is 10 minutes due to processing cycle
  - Intervals shorter than 10 minutes will effectively transfer every 10 minutes
  - Non-10-minute multiples may have irregular timing based on when transfers align with processing cycles
- **Resource Availability**: Transfers will only execute if the source entity has sufficient resources at processing
  time.
- **Multiple Resources**: You can transfer multiple different resources in a single transfer order.
- **Conditional Logic**: Maintain Stock and Depletion transfers check conditions each cycle and only transfer when
  thresholds are met.

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic production orders or simple recurring transfers to understand the system.
2. **Monitor Initially**: Watch your first few automation cycles to ensure orders work as expected.
3. **Use Priorities**: Set appropriate priorities when you have multiple orders to control execution sequence.
4. **Plan for Delays**: Account for the 10-minute processing cycle when planning time-sensitive operations.
5. **Check Resource Flows**: Regularly verify that your automated transfers are maintaining desired resource
   distributions.

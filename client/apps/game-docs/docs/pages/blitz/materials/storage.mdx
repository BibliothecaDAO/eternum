# ðŸ“¦ Storage System

Your available storage limits the amount of materials your Realm can hold. Each Realm begins with a base capacity of
**20,000 kg**. You'll need to construct storehouses to expand your storage capabilities.

## Material Weights

Materials have different weights that affect storage:

## Storehouses

Each storehouse adds 20,000 kg of storage capacity. Lords must be careful not to exceed the storage capacity of their
Realms, as any produced materials that cannot be stored will be permanently lost.

## World Structure Storage

All world structures have set storage capacities **(that cannot be expanded through the use of storehouses)**. These
capacities are as follows:

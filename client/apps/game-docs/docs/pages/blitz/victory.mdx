## Scoring System

Blitz uses a comprehensive scoring system to determine winners. The top 15% of players with the highest Total Score at the end of the three-hour game share in the $LORDS prize pool.

## Total Score Components

Your Total Score is calculated by combining three distinct scoring categories:

### Economy Score
A measure of the scale and success of your economy throughout the game.

**Scoring Factors:**
- Total production rate across all resources
- Number and variety of buildings constructed
- Production diversity (different resource types)
- Donkeys burned in use for logistics
- Total population across all Realms

### Military Score
A measure of your military prowess and combat effectiveness.

**Scoring Factors:**
- Total number of troops deployed across all armies
- Casualties inflicted on enemy forces
- Bandit battles won during exploration
- World structures controlled (hyperstructures, camps, essence wells)
- Player battles won against other Lords
- Realms captured from opponents

### Objective Score
A measure of your ability to explore the map and claim strategic objectives.

**Scoring Factors:**
- Number of tiles explored across the world map
- Hyperstructures claimed and controlled
- Hyperstructure points accumulated (though these don't determine victory)

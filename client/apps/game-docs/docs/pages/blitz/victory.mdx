## Scoring System

Leaderboard placing is determined by total accumulated Victory Points (VP), a measure of a Lord's ability to explore the
map and control World Structures. Victory Points are awarded for:

- Exploring tiles
- Claiming World Structures (Essence Rifts and Camps)
- Claiming Hyperstructures
- Holding Hyperstructures throughout the game

_Note: VP for claiming World Structures and Hyperstructures are only rewarded the first time a structure is captured (from bandit
forces)._

## Hyperstructure Victory Points

Hyperstructures provide ongoing Victory Points based on the number of surrounding player Realms. The VP/second earned from holding 
a hyperstructure is determined by the number of Realms within 8 tiles.

This system rewards players who can capture hyperstructures in high-traffic areas where many players spawn, while hyperstructures in remote locations with no nearby players provide no ongoing VP benefits. Capturing a hyperstructure from resident bandits will always yield the VP for the feat of claiming it, even if it offers no ongoing control VP.

The number of VP awarded for each feat described above is as follows:

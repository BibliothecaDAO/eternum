## Scoring System

Leaderboard placing is determined by Score, a measure of the Lord's ability to explore the map and control
Hyperstructures. Score is determined by:

- Number of tiles explored
- Unique World Structures claimed
- Unique Hyperstructures claimed
- Hyperstructure points accumulated

_Note: Details of the weightings that these feats will have on a Lord's Score are yet to be finalized._

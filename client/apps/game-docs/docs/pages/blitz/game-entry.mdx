# Game Entry

While an Eternum season is a single game instance that unfolds over several weeks, Blitz games are frequently hosted to
allow players to jump into the action at a time that suits them. Competitive Blitz tournaments, composed of Warrior and
Elite bracket games are organized into 'series' that are hosted in the development period between Eternum seasons.
Recruit and Gladiator bracket games are hosted continuously on a rotating timetable.

Unlike Eternum, Blitz does not require ownership of Realms NFTs or Season Passes for entry. Entry requirements and
stakes are determined by the bracket that players choose to compete in.

## Bracket System

Blitz gameplay is structured around multiple brackets with varying stakes and entry requirements, catering to different
playstyles and competitiveness levels.

🍻 **Recruit Bracket - No Stakes**

Free-to-enter bracket for introduction, playtesting and practice, allowing players to experience Blitz gameplay with no
stakes. Recruit games run multiple times per day on a rotating schedule to encourage participation from players in all
time zones.

💰 **Gladiator Bracket - $LORDS Stakes**

Competitive games with $LORDS stakes. Players pay a $LORDS entry fee, contributing to a shared prize pool which is split
between the top 20% of players by score at the end of the game. All players have a chance to earn additional Loot Chest
rewards. Games run daily on a rotating schedule.

🏅 **Warrior Bracket - Series Games**

These games form the bulk of a competitive Blitz Series. Players pay a $LORDS entry fee, contributing to a shared prize
pool which is split between the top 20% of players by score at the end of the game. All players have a chance at earning
additional rewards in the form of Blitz Rewards Chests. The highest placing players can also win tradable NFT invites to
the Elite bracket. Games run according to the series schedule, but primarily during prime time for key timezones (USA,
Europe, Asia-Pacific).

🏆 **Elite Bracket - Series Finals**

Representing the highest level of Blitz gameplay, Elite bracket games are considered the 'finals' of a Blitz Series.
Entry requires an NFT invite from Warrior bracket (no additional $LORDS cost). These games offer large, DAO-funded prize
pools along with coveted Elite Blitz Rewards Chests. A limited number of Elite games are run at the end of
a Blitz series.

## Realm Control Mechanics

Each Lord starts the game in control of three equally capable Realms. As in Eternum, Realms in Blitz can be conquered by
other Lords, encouraging constant vigilance and strategic interaction. Lords must carefully balance their military
forces, territorial positioning, and resource management to survive and thrive within the intense two-hour game
duration. There is no progression beyond the conclusion of the game, and each game instance starts with a refreshed
world state.

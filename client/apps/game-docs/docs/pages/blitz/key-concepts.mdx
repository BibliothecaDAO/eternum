# 🔑 Key Concepts

<img src="/images/covers/blitz-key-concepts.png" alt="Blitz Key Concepts" className="w-full rounded-lg my-6" />

Realms: Blitz is a real-time strategy variant of Eternum designed for rapid, competitive play. In each two-hour match,
players strategically manage resources, explore territories, and engage in high-intensity military confrontations.
Blitz's streamlined mechanics and accelerated gameplay require swift decision-making and adaptability, resulting in a
high skill ceiling that rewards skill and experience. The no-stakes Recruit bracket allows new players to learn the
game, while experienced Lords can sharpen their skills or test new strategies in preparation for a Blitz series. Warrior
bracket games, which require a $LORDS entry fee, form the core of each series—where success brings rewards and
qualifications for the coveted Elite games, offering even greater prizes.

## Rule Summary

### Game Duration

Each Blitz game runs for exactly **2 hours**. Eternum Days are one minute in length to support the fast-paced format.

### Realms

- **Three Starting Realms**: Each player starts with three Realms, evenly spaced apart in a triangle formation.
- **Equal Capability**: At the start of the game, all Realms in Blitz are functionally identical.
- **Free Building**: Players can construct any resource building they wish, restricted only by build space and
  population.
- **No Wonders or Villages**: Wonder bonuses and the Village system are not present in Blitz.
- **Conquest Mechanics**: All Realms are vulnerable to capture by other players, encouraging constant vigilance and
  strategic interaction.

### Materials

- **Simplified Resources**: Only 9 resources are available - Wood, Coal, Copper, Ironwood, Cold Iron, Gold, Adamantine,
  Mithril, and Dragonhide.
- **Simplified Food**: Only 1 food type - Wheat.
- **Essence**: New material found by exploring the map and interacting with World Structures, required for some
  production, buildings and upgrades.
- **Labor**: Produced by each Realm at a fixed rate, required for all construction and 'simple mode' production.
- **Donkeys**: Required for moving materials around the world, essential for logistics.
- **Troops**: 3 types (Knights, Crossbowmen, Paladins), 3 tiers (T1, T2, T3).
- **Restricted Bridging**: Players may only bridge Relics into the game (not out).
- **Donkey Cost**: Donkeys only cost food to produce (no $LORDS cost).
- **No P2P Transfers**: No direct transfers or trade between players.

### Buildings

- **Construction**: Standard and simple mode building systems.
- **Building Types**:
  - **The Keep**: Central structure automatically constructed at game start.
  - **Resource Buildings**: Specific buildings for each of the 9 resources.
  - **Economic Buildings**: Includes Farms, Worker Huts, and Markets.
  - **Military Buildings**: Nine different buildings for producing three tiers of each troop type.
- **Placement & Population**: Buildings require buildable hexes and population capacity, with more unlocked as Realms
  are upgraded.

### Production

- **Production Types**:
  - **Food**: Wheat can be produced without inputs.
  - **Resources**: Require combinations of other resources (standard) or labor (simple).
  - **Labor**: Produced by the Keep at a steady rate.
  - **Troops**: Essential for exploration and warfare, with production of higher tier troops requiring lower tier troops
    as inputs.
  - **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport, consumed after a single journey.
- **Altered Rates**: All production rates are increased relative to production requirements for the fast-paced game
  format.

### World Map

- **Exploration System**: Players must explore unrevealed hexes to find essence, claim Hyperstructures, and attack
  neighbors.
- **No Resource Discovery**: Players will no longer find resources when exploring.
- **Essence Discovery**: Players primarily find essence when exploring, along with small stacks of donkeys, T1 troops
  and labor.
- **Relic Discovery**: Powerful Relics can be found in Relic Crates that occasionally appear on the world map.
- **Biomes**: 16 unique biome types affecting combat effectiveness and troop movement.
- **Movement & Stamina**: Armies move using stamina (regenerating at +20 per Phase, +120 per Eternum Day), with costs varying by biome
  and troop type.

### Military

- **Army Composition**: Armies consist of a single troop type and tier.
- **Troop Tiers**: T1, T2, and T3 troops with increasing stamina and combat strength.
- **Combat Factors**: Battles are resolved based on army damage, stamina modifiers, and biome effects.
- **Army Types**:
  - **Field Armies**: Deploy onto the world map for exploration and conquest.
  - **Guard Armies**: Deployed to defense slots to protect structures.
- **Stamina System**: Armies recover +20 stamina each Phase (6 phases per Eternum Day, totaling +120 stamina per day).
- **Biome Effects**: Each troop type has advantages (+30% damage), disadvantages (-30% damage), or no change (0%) in
  specific biomes.
- **Reinforcement Movement**: Players can't transport troops by donkey to World Structures - reinforcements must be
  moved across the map from a Realm.

### Scoring System

Leaderboard placing is determined by total accumulated Victory Points, a measure of a Lord's ability to explore the map
and control World Structures. Victory Points are awarded for:

- Exploring tiles
- Claiming World Structures
- Claiming Hyperstructures
- Holding Hyperstructures throughout the game

### Victory

Victory Points (VP) determine leaderboard ranking. The players with the highest number of VP at the end of the two hours
share in the $LORDS prize pool. This pool is made up of the cumulative entry fees that players pay to enter the game.

## Blitz Variants

Blitz games come in many forms, and can be configured and deployed by anyone. But the majority of Blitz games are deployed
by the core team in the following forms:

### Recruit Bracket 

- **Low Stakes**: Free-to-enter bracket for introduction and practice.
- **No Entry Cost**: No $LORDS required to participate.
- **Prizes**: Relic Chests only.
- **Frequency**: Games run every day on varying schedules to encourage global participation.

### Warrior Bracket

- **Medium Stakes**: Competitive games requiring a $LORDS entry fee.
- **$LORDS Entry Cost**: $LORDS fee contributes to shared prize pool.
- **Prize Distribution**: Top 20% of players share the prize pool.
- **Rewards**: Relic Chests and Blitz Rewards Chests.
- **Special Reward**: Highest placing players win tradable NFT invites to Elite bracket.
- **Frequency**: Games run a few times weekly during prime time for key timezones (USA, Europe, Asia-Pacific).

### Elite Bracket

### Blitz Series

While Recruit games can be deployed and played as frequently as the player base demands, games with stakes
(Warrior/Elite) are organized into 'series'. Each series takes place between Eternum seasons to bridge the gap in
gameplay and provide continuous competitive opportunities.

## Rewards

- **$LORDS Token**: Prize pool distributions for top players.
- **Loot Chests**: Relic Chests, Blitz Rewards Chests and Elite Blitz Rewards Chests containing consumables and cosmetic
  items.

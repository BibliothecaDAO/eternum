This section outlines the core mechanics and systems that form the foundation of Blitz's fast-paced, competitive gameplay.

## Blitz Brackets

Blitz operates on a three-tier competitive system:

### Recruit Bracket
- **'Bronze tier'** game mode for introduction, familiarisation and no-pressure gameplay
- **Free entry** - no cost to participate
- **Prizes**: Common Relic Chests only
- **Frequency**: Can be played consistently and frequently throughout the year

### Warrior Bracket
- **'Silver tier'** game mode for competitive games
- **Held three times weekly**, one for each key time zone
- **Entry cost**: x $LORDS to enter, supplies a prize pool
- **Prize distribution**: Top 15% of players share the prize pool (supplemented by DAO funds)
- **Rewards**: Common, Rare and Epic Relic Chests
- **Special reward**: Top 5% of players in each round win tradable NFT invites to the Elite bracket

### Elite Bracket
- **'Gold tier'** games for the highest level of competition
- **Held at the end of the series** (likely a single game or three games for each time zone)
- **Entry requirement**: NFT invite from a Warrior game (no additional $LORDS cost)
- **Prize pool**: Largest $LORDS prize pool of the series
- **Rewards**: Common, Rare and Epic Relic Chests, plus additional cosmetic & title prizes for top players

## Blitz Series

While Recruit games can be played consistently throughout the year, games with stakes (Warrior/Elite) are organized into 'series'. Series A is the first set of Blitz games. Each series takes place between other game seasons to bridge the gap in gameplay.

## Game Phases

### Entry Phase
- Starts x days prior to event start
- Players register and pay the x $LORDS entry fee (if Warrior) or use invite NFT (if Elite)
- Players wait until the round begins

### Settling / Preparation Phase
- Starts 30 minutes prior to start
- Entries are closed
- The world is populated and players can spectate, but no actions can be taken until the Game Phase

### Game Phase
- Active gameplay period

### Prize Phase
- Prizes distributed by contract

## Realms

- **Three Realms per Player**: Each player starts with three Realms, evenly spaced apart in a triangle
- **No Specific Resources**: All Realms in Blitz are functionally the same - no specific resource types
- **Free Building**: Players are free to construct any resource building they wish but are restricted by build space and population
- **No Progression Path**: Realms do not upgrade from Settlements â†’ Cities â†’ Kingdoms â†’ Empires
- **No Wonders**: Wonder bonuses are not present in Blitz
- **No Villages**: Village system is not available in Blitz

## Materials

- **Simplified Resources**: 9 core resources (Food simplified to just Wheat)
- **Essence**: New resource found by exploring the map and interacting with world structures
- **Labor and Donkeys**: Present in the game as normal
- **Troops**: 3 types, 3 tiers as normal
- **No Bridging**: Players may only bridge relics into the game (not out)
- **Donkey Cost**: Donkeys only cost food to produce (no $LORDS cost)

## Buildings

- **Construction**: Standard building system available
- **Building Types**:
  - **The Keep**: Central structure automatically constructed when settling
  - **Resource Buildings**: Specific buildings for each of the 9 resources
  - **Economic Buildings**: Includes Farms, Worker Huts, Storehouses
  - **Military Buildings**: Nine different buildings for producing three tiers of each troop type
- **Placement & Population**: Buildings require buildable hexes and population capacity

## Production

- **Production Types**:
  - **Food**: Wheat can be produced without inputs
  - **Resources**: Require combinations of other resources
  - **Labor**: Produced by burning resources in the Keep
  - **Troops**: Essential for exploration and warfare, with higher tiers requiring lower tier troops as inputs
  - **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport, consumed after a single journey
- **Increased Rates**: All production rates are increased for the fast-paced Blitz format
- **Altered Recipes**: Production and building recipes are modified for Blitz

## World Map

- **Exploration System**: Players must explore unrevealed hexes to claim hyperstructures and attack neighbors
- **No Resource Discovery**: Players will no longer find resources when exploring (non-bridgeable)
- **Essence Discovery**: Players primarily find Essence when exploring, along with small stacks of donkeys, T1 troops and labor
- **Relic Discovery**: Rare powerful relics can be found when exploring or in Camp inventories
- **Biomes**: 16 unique biome types affecting combat effectiveness and troop movement
- **Movement & Stamina**: Armies move using stamina (regenerating at +60 per Blitz Day), with costs varying by biome and troop type
- **Time Scale**: Blitz Days are 5 minutes each, so 36 Blitz Days total in a 3-hour game

## Military

- **Army Composition**: Armies consist of a single troop type and tier (Knights, Crossbowmen, or Paladins)
- **Troop Tiers**: T1, T2, and T3 troops with increasing combat strength
- **Combat Factors**: Battles resolved based on army damage, stamina modifiers, and biome effects
- **Army Types**:
  - **Field Armies**: Deploy onto the world map for exploration and conquest
  - **Guard Armies**: Deployed to defense slots to protect structures
- **Stamina System**: Armies recover +60 stamina daily
- **Biome Effects**: Each troop type has advantages (+30% damage), disadvantages (-30% damage), or no change (0%) in specific biomes
- **No P2P Transfers**: No direct transfers or trade between players
- **Reinforcement Movement**: Players can't transport troops by donkey to hyperstructures - reinforcements must be moved across the map from a Realm

## Scoring System

Leaderboard placing is determined by Total Score, which combines three scoring systems:

### Economy Score
A measure of the scale and success of a player's economy. Score is determined by:
- Total production rate
- Buildings constructed
- Production diversity
- Donkeys burned in use
- Population

### Military Score
A measure of the scale and success of a player's military. Score is determined by:
- Number of troops deployed
- Casualties inflicted
- Bandit battles won
- World structures controlled
- Player battles won
- Realms captured

### Objective Score
A measure of the player's ability to explore the map and claim hyperstructures. Score is determined by:
- Number of tiles explored
- Hyperstructures claimed
- Hyperstructure points accumulated

## Victory Conditions

Blitz uses a scoring-based system rather than victory points. The top 15% of players with the highest Total Score at the end of the three hours share in the $LORDS prize pool. This pool includes $LORDS secured for Series A of Blitz by BIP, as well as a percentage of the cumulative entry fees that players pay to enter the game.

## Game Duration

Each Blitz game runs for exactly **3 hours**. Blitz Days are 5 minutes each, resulting in 36 Blitz Days total per game.

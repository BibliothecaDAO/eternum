# 🔑 Key Concepts

<img src="/images/covers/blitz-key-concepts.png" alt="Blitz Key Concepts" className="w-full rounded-lg my-6" />

Realms: Blitz is a real-time strategy variant of Eternum designed for rapid, competitive play. In each two-hour match,
players strategically manage resources, explore territories, and engage in high-intensity military confrontations.
Blitz's streamlined mechanics and accelerated gameplay require swift decision-making and adaptability, resulting in a
high skill ceiling that rewards skill and experience. The no-stakes Recruit bracket allows new players to learn the
game, while experienced Lords can sharpen their skills in preparation for higher-stakes games. Lords can compete for
$LORDS token stakes in Gladiator bracket, while Warrior bracket games form the core of a Blitz 'series'—where success
brings additional Loot Chest rewards and invitations to the coveted Elite bracket, which offers even greater prizes!

## Rule Summary

### Game Duration

Each Blitz game runs for exactly **2 hours**. Time is measured in Eternum Days, which are six minutes long and divided
into six 'phases'.

### Realms

- **Three Starting Realms**: Each player starts with three Realms, evenly spaced apart in a triangle formation.
- **Equal Capability**: At the start of the game, all Realms in Blitz are functionally identical.
- **Free Building**: Players can construct any resource building they wish, restricted only by build space and
  population.
- **No Wonders or Villages**: Wonder bonuses and the Village system are not present in Blitz.
- **Conquest Mechanics**: All Realms are vulnerable to capture by other players, any armies of a captured Realm will
  become the property of the conquering Lord.

### Materials

- **Simplified Resources**: Only 9 resources are available - Wood, Coal, Copper, Ironwood, Cold Iron, Gold, Adamantine,
  Mithril, and Dragonhide.
- **Simplified Food**: Only 1 food type - Wheat.
- **Essence**: New material found by exploring the map and interacting with World Structures, required for some
  production, buildings and upgrades.
- **Labor**: Produced by each Realm at a fixed rate, required for all construction and 'labor mode' production.
- **Donkeys**: Required for moving materials around the world, essential for logistics.
- **Troops**: 3 types (Knights, Crossbowmen, Paladins), 3 tiers (T1, T2, T3).
- **Restricted Bridging**: Players may only bridge Relics into the game (not out). Other materials can't be bridged.
  _Note: This feature is a work in progress, the tokenized Relics and Relic Chest system is not active yet._
- **Donkey Cost**: Donkeys only cost food to produce (no $LORDS cost).
- **No P2P Transfers**: No direct transfers or trade between players.

### Buildings

- **Construction**: 'Resource mode' and 'labor mode' building systems.
- **Building Types**:
  - **The Keep**: Central structure automatically constructed at game start.
  - **Resource Buildings**: Specific buildings for each of the 9 resources.
  - **Economic Buildings**: Includes Farms, Worker Huts, and Markets.
  - **Military Buildings**: Nine different buildings for producing three tiers of each troop type.
- **Placement & Population**: Buildings require buildable hexes and population capacity, with more unlocked as Realms
  are upgraded.

### Production

- **Production Types**:
  - **Food**: Wheat can be produced without inputs.
  - **Resources**: Require combinations of other resources (resource mode) or labor (labor mode).
  - **Labor**: Produced by the Keep at a steady rate.
  - **Troops**: Essential for exploration and warfare, with production of higher tier troops requiring lower tier troops
    as inputs.
  - **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport, consumed after a single journey.
- **Altered Rates**: All production rates are increased relative to production requirements for the fast-paced game
  format.

### World Map

- **Exploration System**: Players must explore unrevealed hexes to find essence, claim Hyperstructures, and attack
  neighbors.
- **Essence Discovery**: Players primarily find essence when exploring, along with small stacks of donkeys, T1 troops
  and labor. Resources cannot be discovered through exploration.
- **Relic Discovery**: Powerful Relics can be found in Relic Crates that occasionally appear on the world map.
- **Biomes**: 16 unique biome types affecting combat effectiveness and troop movement.
- **Movement & Stamina**: Armies move using stamina (regenerating at +20 per Phase, +120 per Eternum Day), with costs
  varying by biome and troop type.

### Military

- **Army Composition**: Armies consist of a single troop type and tier.
- **Troop Tiers**: T1, T2, and T3 troops with increasing stamina and combat strength.
- **Combat Factors**: Battles are resolved based on army damage, stamina modifiers, and biome effects.
- **Army Types**:
  - **Field Armies**: Deploy onto the world map for exploration and conquest.
  - **Guard Armies**: Deployed to defense slots to protect structures.
- **Stamina System**: Armies recover +20 stamina each Phase (6 phases per Eternum Day, totaling +120 stamina per day).
- **Biome Effects**: Each troop type has advantages (+30% damage), disadvantages (-30% damage), or no change (0%) in
  specific biomes.
- **Reinforcement Movement**: Players can't transport troops by donkey to World Structures - reinforcements must be
  moved across the map from a Realm.

### Scoring System

Leaderboard placing is determined by total accumulated Victory Points, a measure of a Lord's ability to explore the map
and control World Structures. Victory Points are awarded for:

- Exploring tiles
- Claiming World Structures
- Opening Relic Crates
- Claiming Hyperstructures
- Holding Hyperstructures throughout the game

### Victory

Victory Points (VP) determine leaderboard ranking. The players with the highest number of VP at the end of the two hours
share in the $LORDS prize pool. This pool is made up of the cumulative entry fees that players pay to enter the game.

Realms: Blitz is a real-time strategy variant of Eternum designed for rapid, competitive play. In each two-hour match,
players strategically manage resources, explore territories, and engage in high-intensity military confrontations.
Blitz's streamlined mechanics and accelerated gameplay require swift decision-making and adaptability, resulting in a
high skill ceiling that rewards skill and experience. The no-stakes Recruit bracket allows new players to learn the
game, while experienced Lords can sharpen their skills or test new strategies in preparation for a Blitz series. Warrior
bracket games, which require a $LORDS entry fee, form the core of each seriesâ€”where success brings rewards and
qualifications for the coveted Elite games, offering even greater prizes.

## Rule Summary

### Game Duration

Each Blitz game runs for exactly **2 hours**. Eternum Days are 5 minutes in length to support the fast-paced format,
with armies recovering +60 stamina daily.

### Realms

- **Three Starting Realms**: Each player starts with three Realms, evenly spaced apart in a triangle formation.
- **Equal Capability**: All Realms in Blitz are functionally identical.
- **Free Building**: Players can construct any resource building they wish, restricted only by build space and
  population.
- **No Wonders or Villages**: Wonder bonuses and the Village system are not present in Blitz.
- **Conquest Mechanics**: All Realms are vulnerable to capture by other players, encouraging constant vigilance and
  strategic interaction.

### Materials

- **Simplified Resources**: Only 9 resources are available - Wood, Coal, Copper, Ironwood, Cold Iron, Gold, Adamantine,
  Mithril, and Dragonhide.
- **Simplified Food**: Only 1 food type - Wheat.
- **Essence**: New material found by exploring the map and interacting with World Structures, required for some
  production, buildings and upgrades.
- **Labor**: Required for all construction and 'simple mode' production, acquired through burning resources.
- **Donkeys**: Required for moving materials around the world, essential for logistics.
- **Troops**: 3 types (Knights, Crossbowmen, Paladins), 3 tiers (T1, T2, T3).
- **No Bridging**: Players may only bridge relics into the game (not out).
- **Donkey Cost**: Donkeys only cost food to produce (no $LORDS cost).
- **No P2P Transfers**: No direct transfers or trade between players.

### Buildings

- **Construction**: Standard and simple mode building systems.
- **Building Types**:
  - **The Keep**: Central structure automatically constructed at game start.
  - **Resource Buildings**: Specific buildings for each of the 9 resources.
  - **Economic Buildings**: Includes Farms, Worker Huts, Storehouses, and markets.
  - **Military Buildings**: Nine different buildings for producing three tiers of each troop type.
- **Placement & Population**: Buildings require buildable hexes and population capacity, with more unlocked as Realms
  are upgraded.

### Production

- **Production Types**:
  - **Food**: Wheat can be produced without inputs.
  - **Resources**: Require combinations of other resources (standard) or labor (simple).
  - **Labor**: Produced by burning resources in the Keep.
  - **Troops**: Essential for exploration and warfare, with higher tiers requiring lower tier troops as inputs.
  - **Donkeys**: One-time-use transport, consumed after a single journey.
- **Altered Rates**: All production rates are increased for the fast-paced game format.

### World Map

- **Exploration System**: Players must explore unrevealed hexes to find Essence, claim Hyperstructures, and attack
  neighbors.
- **No Resource Discovery**: Players will no longer find resources when exploring.
- **Essence Discovery**: Players primarily find Essence when exploring, along with small stacks of donkeys, T1 troops
  and labor.
- **Relic Discovery**: Powerful relics can be found in Relic Crates that occasionally appear on the world map.
- **Biomes**: 16 unique biome types affecting combat effectiveness and troop movement.
- **Movement & Stamina**: Armies move using stamina (regenerating at +60 per Blitz Day), with costs varying by biome and
  troop type.

### Military

- **Army Composition**: Armies consist of a single troop type and tier.
- **Troop Tiers**: T1, T2, and T3 troops with increasing stamina and combat strength.
- **Combat Factors**: Battles are resolved based on army damage, stamina modifiers, and biome effects.
- **Army Types**:
  - **Field Armies**: Deploy onto the world map for exploration and conquest.
  - **Guard Armies**: Deployed to defense slots to protect structures.
- **Stamina System**: Armies recover +60 stamina daily.
- **Biome Effects**: Each troop type has advantages (+30% damage), disadvantages (-30% damage), or no change (0%) in
  specific biomes.
- **Reinforcement Movement**: Players can't transport troops by donkey to World Structures - reinforcements must be
  moved across the map from a Realm.

### Scoring System

Leaderboard placing is determined by Score, a measure of the Lord's ability to explore the map and claim
Hyperstructures. Score is determined by:

- Number of tiles explored
- World Structures claimed
- Hyperstructures claimed
- Hyperstructure points accumulated

### Victory Conditions

Blitz uses a scoring-based system rather than victory points. The players with the highest Total Scores on the
leaderboard at the end of the two hours share in the $LORDS prize pool. This pool is made up of the cumulative entry
fees that players pay to enter the game.

## Blitz Brackets

### Recruit Bracket

- **Low Stakes**: Free-to-enter bracket for introduction and practice.

gameplay and provide continuous competitive opportunities.

## Stamina

Stamina is expended whenever an army moves between hexes, explores previously unrevealed areas, or launches an attack
against enemy forces. Each of these actions has a specific stamina cost, making strategic planning essential to
maximizing an army's effectiveness. Armies regenerate stamina at a consistent rate of +60 stamina per Eternum Day. Each
troop type possesses different maximum stamina capacities, outlined in the table below:

<TroopMovementTable />

Lords should remain cautious about fully depleting the stamina of their armies, as forces with low stamina may find
themselves severely disadvantaged if attacked by enemy forces.

Armies in Eternum can move freely into any adjacent, unoccupied hex. A hex is considered occupied if it contains a
Realm, another army, or a world structure such as a Hyperstructure, Camp, or essence Rift. Armies may also move to more
distant hexes, provided there is a continuous path of adjacent, unoccupied hexes leading to the destination, and the
army has sufficient stamina available for the entire journey.

The amount of stamina consumed when moving into a hex depends on both the biome of that hex and the type of troops
within the army. The table below details biome-specific stamina costs for each troop type:

## Exploring

Exploring your surroundings is a necessary part of Blitz as it allows Lords to reveal paths to objectives, find valuable
essence or other bonuses, and uncover beneficial world structures.

When an army is positioned adjacent to an unexplored hex, Lords may choose to send that army forth to uncover what lies
hidden. Exploring an unknown hex always costs 30 stamina and will reveal that hex to all Lords. If the newly explored
hex contains a world structure, the exploring army will automatically be pushed back to the hex from which they started
without any additional stamina penalty.

During exploration, armies gather any valuables they encounter, receiving the goods directly into their inventory. The
reward chances for any explored hex are as follows:

<span style={{ color: "red" }}>DRAFTING NOTE: Require table of materials that can be found and their stack size.</span>

If an army becomes overencumbered, they will not be able to collect any materials found when exploring. Instead, the
materials will remain on that tile and will be able to be collected by another army with enough capacity. Armies can
return to a structure to offload the materials, or drop them to free up space. Note that any materials discarded in the
field will be permanently lost (burned).

## Troop Transfers

Lords may transfer troops from one army to another, provided that they are on adjacent hexes, the same troop type, and
the same tier. To transfer troops from one army to another, or to a structure, the player first needs to select its army
on the worldmap using left-click, then right-click on the target and select the Transfer -> Transfer Troops tab.
Transferring troops from one army to another with lower stamina makes no change to the stamina of either army.
Transferring from an army with lower stamina to an army with higher stamina will reduce the higher-stamina army to equal
that of the lower stamina army.

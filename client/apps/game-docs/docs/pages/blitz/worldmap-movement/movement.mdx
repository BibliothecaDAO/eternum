# 🧭 Movement & Exploration

## Stamina

Stamina is expended whenever an army moves between hexes, explores previously unrevealed areas, or launches an attack
against enemy forces. Each of these actions has a specific stamina cost, making strategic planning essential to
maximizing an army's effectiveness. Armies regenerate stamina at a consistent rate of +20 stamina per Phase (one
minute), totaling +120 stamina per Eternum Day. Each troop type possesses different maximum stamina capacities, outlined
in the table below:

<BlitzTroopMovementTable />

Lords should remain cautious about fully depleting the stamina of their armies, as forces with low stamina may find
themselves severely disadvantaged if attacked by enemy forces.

## Movement

Armies can move freely into any adjacent, unoccupied hex. A hex is considered occupied if it contains a Realm, another
army, or a World Structure such as a Hyperstructure. Armies may also move to more distant hexes, provided there is a
continuous path of adjacent, unoccupied hexes leading to the destination, and the army has sufficient stamina available
for the entire journey.

The amount of stamina consumed when moving into an explored hex depends on both the biome of that hex and the type of
troops within the army. The table below details biome-specific stamina costs for each troop type:

<BiomeStamina />

Troops also require Wheat to move. This is consumed from their home Realm when a movement order is executed. Each unit
consumes **0.03** Wheat to traverse or explore a new tile.

## Exploring

Exploring your surroundings is a necessary part of Blitz as it allows Lords to reveal paths to objectives, find valuable
Essence or other bonuses, and uncover beneficial world structures.

When an army is positioned adjacent to an unexplored hex, Lords may choose to send that army forth to uncover what lies
hidden. Exploring an unknown hex always costs 30 stamina and will reveal that hex to all Lords, permanently expanding
the known boundaries of the world. If the newly explored hex contains a World Structure, the exploring army will
automatically be pushed back to the hex from which they started without any additional stamina penalty.

During exploration, armies gather any valuables they encounter, receiving the goods directly into their inventory. The
reward chances for any explored hex are as follows:

<ExplorationRewards />

Exploration rewards are automatically sent back to the home Realm of the exploring army, so armies aren't limited by
their carry capacity in Blitz. However, the mist is a scary place and troops don't like to delve into it alone, so a
minimum of 10 troops are required in an army to explore a hex.

## Troop Transfers

Lords may transfer troops from one army to another, provided that they are on adjacent hexes, the same troop type, and
the same tier. To transfer troops from one army to another, or to a structure, the player first needs to select its army
on the worldmap using left-click, then right-click on the target and select the Transfer Troops tab. Troops can be
transferred between armies (and Realm defense slots) at any time, and transfers are not impacted by battle timers.
However, in all instances of a troop transfer, the army that has received troops:

- adopts the **lower** of the two armies' stamina values, and
- adopts the **higher** of the two armies' battle timers.

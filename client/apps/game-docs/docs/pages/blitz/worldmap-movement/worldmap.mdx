# üó∫Ô∏è The World Map

<img src="/images/covers/05.png" alt="Eternum World Map" className="w-full rounded-lg my-6" />

## An Unexplored World

At the beginning of each Blitz game, the world lies largely unexplored. The only exceptions are the settled Realms and
the array of Hyperstructures which can be seen in the World view, arranged in expanding rings around the center of the
map. The six hexes adjacent to these structures are also revealed, but beyond these instances, the world remains cloaked
by the mist, waiting for ambitious Lords to send forth their armies to explore. Once a hex is explored, the state of the
hex (i.e. the biome and whether it contains a world structure) is permanently revealed to all Lords.

## Map Layout

### Hyperstructure Positioning

The number of registered Lords for a game of Blitz determines the size of the map and the number of Hyperstructures
available for Lords to compete over. A single Hyperstructure marks the center of the map, around which other concentric
Hyperstructure 'rings' are spawned every 18 hexes until all players are accommodated.

The number of Hyperstructure rings is determined by:

```
r = ‚àö(P/6)
```

Where:

- **P** is the number of players (Lords) registered to play in the session
- **r** is the number of Hyperstructure rings
- If **r** is not an integer, then it is rounded up to the nearest integer

The number of Hyperstructures in a ring is determined by:

```
H<sub>r</sub> = 6r
```

Where:

- **H<sub>r</sub>** is the number of Hyperstructures in ring **r**
- **r** is the ring number (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### Realm Positioning

Once the size of the map and the number of Hyperstructures are determined, player positions are determined within the
bounds of the Hyperstructure rings. While the order in which players are placed is randomised, the positioning is
sequential and follows a rotational pattern to distribute Lords as evenly as possible and attempt to ensure equal
opportunity in accessing the Hyperstructure objectives. The map structure and placement sequence is visualised below:

The Realms of each participating Lord are positioned six hexes apart in a triangle formation. Each Realm is also located
within eight hexes of a Hyperstructure, and eight hexes from the nearest Realm belonging to another Lord (assuming all
available player positions are filled).

    There is no immunity period in Blitz. All Realms are able to be attacked and claimed from the moment the game
    begins.

## Biomes

Each hex is assigned one of 16 biome types, each with unique aesthetics and strategic implications. These biomes are
procedurally generated across the world map following specific rules that dictate their distribution, with certain
biomes naturally occurring more or less frequently than others.

Biomes impact both combat effectiveness and troop movement. Each troop type‚ÄîKnights, Crossbowmen, and Paladins‚Äîcan
potentially be advantaged or disadvantaged in battle depending on the biome in which combat takes place; this is
explained in more detail in the [Military](/blitz/military/stamina-and-biomes) section. Additionally, biomes have the
potential to enhance or impede army maneuvers, as the various biomes impact the stamina consumption of each troop type
differently as they move between hexes‚Äîthis is explained further in the
[Movement & Exploration](/blitz/worldmap-movement/movement) section below.

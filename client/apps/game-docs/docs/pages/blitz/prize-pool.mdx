# Prize Pool & Distribution

Blitz competitive games feature a prize distribution system that ensures fair rewards for top-ranked Lords while
maintaining sustainable game economics. This system is designed to be flexible and can be adapted for use with any token
on Starknet, allowing game hosts to deploy their own games with customized prize distribution settings.

## Entry Fee Structure

Every Blitz match in the Gladiator and Warrior brackets currently collects an entry fee of **250 LORDS** per player.
This fee is allocated to support both player rewards and the ecosystem:

- **80%** of the entry fee forms the **prize pool** that gets distributed among winners
- **20%** of the entry fee is kept as a fee (distribution of this fee within the ecosystem is TBC)

At the conclusion of each Blitz match, players are ranked by their final score. The **top 20% of the field** (rounded up
to the nearest whole player) are designated as winners and eligible for prize distribution.

## Prize Distribution Mechanics

The prize distribution system employs a weighting formula that ensures fair and predictable rewards. Each winner first
receives a **refund of their 250 LORDS buy-in**, and the remainder of the prize pool is then distributed among winners
according to a geometric weighting system based on finishing rank.

### Weighting System

The weighting system uses a decay factor that adjusts based on lobby size, ensuring appropriate reward curves for
different game scales. The decay factor `s` is calculated using the formula:

`s(n) = min(0.95, 0.2 × log10(n) + 0.4)`

Where `n` represents the number of players in the match. This formula creates steeper reward curves in smaller lobbies
and flatter curves in larger ones, but never flatter than 0.95.

### Individual Winner Calculations

Each winner's bonus is calculated using their individual weight divided by the total weight sum. The weight for rank `i`
is `s^(i-1)`, meaning the top finisher has a weight of 1, second place has weight `s`, third place has weight `s²`, and
so on. The total weight sum `W` is calculated as the sum of this geometric series.

The bonus for each winner is then calculated as: `bonus_i = (weight_i / W) × R`

Where `R` represents the remainder of the prize pool after refunds are distributed.

## Flexibility and Customization

This prize distribution system is designed to be adaptable for various gaming scenarios. Game hosts can deploy their own
Blitz games with modified prize distribution settings, adjusting factors such as entry fees, winner percentages, and
decay factors to suit their specific requirements. The system can also be configured to work with any token on Starknet,
making it versatile for different blockchain gaming ecosystems.

## NFT Prize Distribution

The NFT prize distribution system for Blitz games is currently under development. This system will allow for the
distribution of unique digital assets, collectibles, and special rewards that complement the existing $LORDS prize
pools. Until the NFT distribution system is fully implemented, Blitz game rewards will be handled offchain.

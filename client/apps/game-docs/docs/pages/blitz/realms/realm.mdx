# üè∞ Realms

In Blitz, each Lord starts the game commanding three Realms, evenly spaced in a triangular formation. These Realms are
functionally identical and are not related to the 8,000 Realm NFTs that are the basis of Eternum. They can produce any
of the nine resources available in Blitz and are equally capable in all aspects of the game, limited only by the skill
and strategy of their Lord.

## Settling

Realms are settled during the 30-minute 'Settling Phase' prior to the start of the game. Lords who are
registered to play are drawn at random from the pool and assigned spawn positions sequentially according to the settling
algorithm. Once assigned a map position, Lords are required to confirm their participation in the session by initiating
a 'Settle' transaction, which will place their three Realms in their drawn position. This must be done in the 30-minute
Settling Phase to ensure presence and readiness to play the game. Lords who fail to confirm settling during this phase
will not have their Realms placed and will forfeit participation in the session. Their allocated spawn position will
remain empty throughout the game.

### Settling Algorithm

The number of registered Lords for a session determines the size of the map and the number of Hyperstructures available
for Lords to compete over. A single Hyperstructure marks the center of the map, around which other concentric
Hyperstructure 'rings' are spawned every 18 hexes until all players are accommodated. The details of Hyperstructure
spawns are explained in greater detail in the [World Map](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap) section.

Once the size of the map and the number of Hyperstructures are determined, player positions are determined within the
bounds of the Hyperstructure rings. While the order in which players are placed is randomised, the positioning is
sequential and follows a rotational pattern to distribute Lords as evenly as possible and attempt to ensure equal
opportunity in accessing the Hyperstructure objectives. The map structure and placement sequence for an example of 24
players is visualized below:

          <td style={table.cell}>3,000</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>

_Note: The type of T1 troop depends on the biome that the realm is spawned on. Starting troops will always have a
combat advantage when defending their home._

### Realm Progression

Realms can grow from a Settlement into a City, then to a Kingdom, and finally an Empire. Each upgrade level unlocks
additional buildable hexes and defensive army slots, allowing for the expansion of your economy and strengthening of
your defenses. Each progression requires specific materials, outlined in the table below:

# üè∞ Realms

In Blitz, each Lord starts the game commanding three Realms, evenly spaced in a triangular formation. These Realms are functionally identical and are not related to the 8,000 Realm NFTs that are the basis of Eternum.
They can produce any of the nine resources available in Blitz and are equally capable in all aspects of the game, limited only by the skill and strategy of their Lord.

## Realm Details

### Settling

Realms are settled at the start of the 30-minute 'Settling Phase' prior to the start of the game. Lords who are registered to play are drawn at random from the pool and assigned spawn positions sequentially according to the settling algorithm.
Once assigned a map position, Lords are required to confirm their participation in the session by initiating a 'Settle' transaction, which will place their three Realms in their drawn position.
This must be done in the 30-minute Settling Phase to ensure presence and readiness to play the game. Lords who fail to confirm settling during this phase will not have their Realms placed and will forfeit participation in the session. Their allocated spawn position will remain empty throughout the game.

### Starting Resources

<span style={{ color: "red" }}>DRAFTING NOTE: Insert table. Include starting military units as they all start in inventory (none deployed).</span>

### Realm Progression

Realms can grow from a Settlement into a City, then to a Kingdom, and finally an Empire. Each upgrade level unlocks
additional buildable hexes and defensive army slots, allowing for the expansion of your economy and strengthening of
your defences. Each progression requires specific materials, outlined in the table below:

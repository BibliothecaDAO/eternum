# üè∞ Realms

In Blitz, each Lord starts the game commanding three Realms, evenly spaced in a triangular formation. These Realms are
functionally identical and are not related to the 8,000 Realm NFTs that are the basis of Eternum. They can produce any
of the nine resources available in Blitz and are equally capable in all aspects of the game, limited only by the skill
and strategy of their Lord.

## Registration

All Lords willing to participate in a Blitz game are required to register prior to the start of the Settling Phase. The
'Registration Phase' is different for each bracket, but in all cases it is used to predetermine the number of players
and establish the size of the game world. Each wallet address can only be registered once per Blitz game. More
information on Blitz registration requirements will be made available prior to launch.

## Settling

Realms can be settled as soon as the game officially starts. This will confirm a Lord's participation in the game and
place their Realms in a randomised spawn position. If a Lord fails to settle their Realms, their spawn position will
remain empty throughout the game and any entry fee paid during registration will be forfeit. Lords should settle their
Realms as soon as possible after the game starts to avoid falling behind their neighbors.

### Settling Algorithm

The number of registered Lords for a session determines the size of the map and the number of Hyperstructures available
for Lords to compete over. A single Hyperstructure marks the center of the map, around which other concentric
Hyperstructure 'rings' are spawned every 15 hexes until all players are accommodated. The details of Hyperstructure
spawns are explained in greater detail in the [World Map](/blitz/worldmap-movement/worldmap) section.

When the game starts, the size of the map and the number of Hyperstructures are finalized. Player positions are randomised
within the bounds of the Hyperstructure rings, following a rotational pattern to distribute Lords as evenly as possible 
to ensure equal opportunity in accessing the Hyperstructure objectives. The map structure and placement sequence for an
example of 24 players is visualized below:

_Note: The type of T1 troop depends on the biome that the realm is spawned on. Starting troops will always have a combat
advantage when defending their home._

### Realm Progression

Realms can grow from a Settlement into a City, then to a Kingdom, and finally an Empire. Each upgrade level unlocks
additional buildable hexes and defensive army slots, allowing for the expansion of your economy and strengthening of
your defenses. Each progression requires specific materials, outlined in the table below:

<BuildableHexes />
<BlitzRealmDefenseSlotsTable />

# üè∞ Realms

In Blitz, each Lord starts the game commanding three Realms, evenly spaced in a triangular formation. These Realms are functionally
identical and are not related to the 8,000 Realm NFTs that are the basis of Eternum. They can produce any of the nine resources available 
in Blitz and are equally capable in all aspects of the game, limited only by the skill and strategy of their Lord.

## Settling

Realms are settled at the start of the 30-minute 'Settling Phase' prior to the start of the game. Lords who are registered to play are 
drawn at random from the pool and assigned spawn positions sequentially according to the settling algorithm. Once assigned a map position, 
Lords are required to confirm their participation in the session by initiating a 'Settle' transaction, which will place their three Realms 
in their drawn position. This must be done in the 30-minute Settling Phase to ensure presence and readiness to play the game. Lords who fail 
to confirm settling during this phase will not have their Realms placed and will forfeit participation in the session. Their allocated spawn 
position will remain empty throughout the game.

### Settling Algorithm

The number of registered Lords for a session determines the size of the map and the number of Hyperstructures available for Lords to compete over. 
A single Hyperstructure marks the center of the map, around which other concentric Hyperstructure 'rings' are spawned every 18 hexes until all players are accommodated.

The number of Hyperstructure rings is determined by:

**r = ‚àö(P/6)**

Where:
- **P** is the number of players (Lords) registered to play in the session
- **r** is the number of Hyperstructure rings
- If **r** is not an integer, then it is rounded up to the nearest integer

The number of Hyperstructures in a ring is determined by:

**H<sub>r</sub> = 6r**

Where:
- **H<sub>r</sub>** is the number of Hyperstructures in ring **r**
- **r** is the ring number (1, 2, 3, etc.)

Once the size of the map and the number of Hyperstructures are determined, player positions are determined within the bounds of the Hyperstructure 
rings. While the order in which players are placed is randomised, the positioning is sequential and follows a rotational pattern to distribute Lords 
as evenly as possible and attempt to ensure equal opportunity in accessing the Hyperstructure objectives. The map structure and placement sequence is visualised below:

    There is no immunity period in Blitz. All Realms are able to be attacked and claimed

### Realm Progression

Realms can grow from a Settlement into a City, then to a Kingdom, and finally an Empire. Each upgrade level unlocks
additional buildable hexes and defensive army slots, allowing for the expansion of your economy and strengthening of
your defences. Each progression requires specific materials, outlined in the table below:

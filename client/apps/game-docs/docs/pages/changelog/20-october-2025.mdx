  (resource/labor), and rewards phrasing.

### Balance Change Summary

- [Production](/blitz/materials/production): Tables updated; mode rename (standard/simple → resource/labor).

- Exploration & Rewards: Relic Crates grant 1,000 VP; minor movement/map clarifications; troop exploration bundles
  reduced (2,500 → 1,000). See [World Map & Movement](/blitz/worldmap-movement/movement) and [Victory](/blitz/victory).

### Technical Improvements

- **Navigation/Sidebar**: Updated sidebar to list Game Entry as sibling items under Key Concepts for both Blitz and
  Eternum; removed the Overview Game Entry link.
- **Prev/Next Order**: Fixed navigation loops for first pages in groups; prev/next now follows sidebar sequence across
  all pages and subpages.
- **Naming Consistency (Blitz)**: Standard/Simple renamed to Resource/Labor across buildings; component props updated. 
  Corrected resource IDs to ensure proper icons in military building cards.
- **Asset Cleanup**: Removed deprecated GIFs no longer referenced after buildings/production updates.

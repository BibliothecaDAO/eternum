# 18th February 2026

### Blitz Prize Pool Rewrite

- [Blitz/Prize Pool](/blitz/prize-pool): Complete rewrite of the prize pool and distribution documentation. Updated
  prize pool composition, tier breakdowns, and distribution mechanics to reflect current game state.

### Component Architecture

- Separated Blitz and Eternum component variants into dedicated directories (`blitz-components/`, `eternum-components/`)
  for clearer maintainability. Affected components: DefendingArmies, HyperstructureRings, TroopMovementTable,
  WeightTable, ResourceProduction, RewardsChestTable, and others.
- Introduced shared `styles.ts` design system with consistent color palette, spacing, and reusable table/section/stats
  styles across all components.

### Visual Overhaul

- Applied a Realms-themed design language across all documentation pages: dark card backgrounds, brass/gold accent
  colors, consistent typography (Exo 2 headings), and hover states on table rows.
- Rebuilt sidebar navigation with collapsible sections, chevron toggles, and improved hierarchy.
- Fixed table dead space issues on Deployment Caps and Prize Pool Composition tables.
- Centre-aligned numeric columns across multiple tables: Deployment Caps, Guard Slots, Damage Comparison, Max Stamina,
  Buildable Hexes, Armies by Realm Level, and Starting Materials (Realms and Camps).
- Reduced loot chest table cell margins to allow more width for description columns.
- Unbolded numeric figures in Troop Tier Stats tables for cleaner readability.
- Restructured Troop Movement stats as a flat list layout.
- Added global mobile overflow protection for all tables.
- Changed Hyperstructure ring formula notation from √(P/6) to (P/6)^(1/2).
- Converted damage refund calculation rules to code blocks for consistency.

### Content Updates

- [Overview/Introduction](/overview/introduction): Linked 'Eternum' and 'Blitz' in Game Modes section to their
  respective key concept pages.
- [Blitz/Loot Chests](/overview/chests/contents): Updated Blitz and Eternum rewards chest tables with revised item
  descriptions and column layout.
- [Blitz/Armies](/blitz/military/armies): Converted Deployment Caps to inline HTML table with fixed layout.
- [Blitz/Game Entry](/blitz/game-entry): Minor content adjustments.
- [Blitz/MMR](/blitz/mmr): Removed redundant content.
- [Development/Getting Started](/development/getting-started): Added setup notes.
- Multiple Eternum section pages: Minor cross-reference and link fixes.

### Sidebar & Navigation

- Restructured `vocs.config.ts` sidebar: reordered sections, added new pages, improved collapsed/expanded defaults.
- Added 18 February 2026 changelog to navigation.

### Changelog Formatting

- Standardised section heading levels across 8th December and 31st January changelog entries.

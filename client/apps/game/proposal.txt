Automation flow

1) Simplify production automation
Instead of several production mode (maintain, once, infinite, etc...) There's only one, of which you can pick from 3 types : labor to resource, resource to resource, resource to labor.
You input the way you want the resource to be produced, the % of resource to be used, and it start the production.
Json for producing: 
[
  {
    "entityId": 181,
    "name": "Sgámsíší",
    "resources": [
      {
        "name": "Copper",
        "percentOfRssToBurnForLaborProd": 10,
        "percentOfRawRssToBurnForRssProd": 30,
        "percentOfLaborToBurnForRssProd": 10
      },
      {
        "name": "Obsidian",
        "percentOfRssToBurnForLaborProd": 10,
        "percentOfRawRssToBurnForRssProd": 30,
        "percentOfLaborToBurnForRssProd": 10
      },
      {
        "name": "Silver",
        "percentOfRssToBurnForLaborProd": 10,
        "percentOfRawRssToBurnForRssProd": 30,
        "percentOfLaborToBurnForRssProd": 10
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "entityId": 205,
    "name": "Noomamu",
    "resources": [
      {
        "name": "Stone",
        "percentOfRssToBurnForLaborProd": 10,
        "percentOfRawRssToBurnForRssProd": 30,
        "percentOfLaborToBurnForRssProd": 10
      },
      {
        "name": "Coal",
        "percentOfRssToBurnForLaborProd": 10,
        "percentOfRawRssToBurnForRssProd": 30,
        "percentOfLaborToBurnForRssProd": 10
      },
      {
        "name": "Copper",
        "percentOfRssToBurnForLaborProd": 10,
        "percentOfRawRssToBurnForRssProd": 30,
        "percentOfLaborToBurnForRssProd": 10
      }
    ]
  }
]

--> All this can be split into multicalls per realm, the client must first get all the rss in the realm, split it evenly (like 30/30/30), prepare the json then sends the multicall. 
This avoids the first order to use up 30% of the 100%, then the second uses 30% of 70% left, then third 30% of 49% etc... Which is a current issue atm.
During eternum s1 I used to run this batching 50 calls at once.

2) How does this translate into the UI :
Let's say you're creating a new wood building. You select the building, you pick standard/simple construct mode and you build it.
By default, it creates automation percentOfRssToBurnForLaborProd = 0% percentOfRawRssToBurnForRssProd = 30% percentOfLaborToBurnForRssProd = 10% therefore the prod is bootstrapped at building creation.
The player can then adjust the 3 types of prod using a slider ranging from 0% to 90% (always keep 10% margin).

3) One step further :
- Calculate that the total amount of a resources consumed does not go over 90% (like if copper is used 4 times and user has setup 30% on each building using copper we are at 120% = fail)
- After every building creation, recalculate how each resource is consumed and adjusts the sliders automatically.
- Ideally, the user selects presets and doesnt even see the sliders (like full rss farming, full army farming prioritize army prod with copper and labor, labor farming, etc...)

4) Cleanup automation and production UI
- For me, the UI and setup must be realm per realm. So I'd remove all the total rss balance, automation, etc for all realms - keep just the one that is currently selected.
- So on the right side of the UI, where we currently have 5 buttons, only have :
	* one panel for the realm balance
	* one panel for the production building and the rate they are currently producing. Put the production presets there. Put a button that opens up a simplified automation modal with the setup for the realm. It should be very compact and only used by advanced players.
	And that should be it for the production/automation UI.

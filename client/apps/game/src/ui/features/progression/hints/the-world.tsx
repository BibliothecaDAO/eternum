Venture into the unknown to discover vital resources, claim valuable Fragment Mines that yield Ancient Fragments, and secure Hyperstructure Foundations. Engage in a dynamic, player-driven economy where every material is produced and traded. Raise armies not just for conquest, but to defend your holdings and project your power. Form or join Tribes to cooperate, strategize, and wage wars.

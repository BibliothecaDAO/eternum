        Tribes are groups of players that work together to achieve common goals. Tribes can be created by any player and
        can have any number of members. Being part of a tribe is essential to success in Eternum.

        <br />A tribe can be either public or private. Anyone can join a public tribe, but only the owner of a private
        tribe can invite other players.

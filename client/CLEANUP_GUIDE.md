# Eternum Client Cleanup Guide

## üéØ Executive Summary

This guide provides a comprehensive cleanup strategy for the Eternum game client, focusing on improving code quality,
maintainability, and developer experience. The recent refactoring has established a solid feature-based architecture,
but there are still opportunities for improvement in consistency, testing, and UI development workflow.

## üìã Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well

1. **Feature-Based Architecture**: The recent refactoring successfully reorganized components into logical domains
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is well-separated from UI components
3. **Modern Tech Stack**: Using Vite, React 18, TypeScript, and modern state management (Zustand)
4. **Three.js Integration**: Good separation between 3D logic and UI components

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

1. **Design System Inconsistencies**
   - Multiple button variants with overlapping styles
   - Inconsistent component API patterns
   - Mixed styling approaches (Tailwind classes, inline styles, CSS modules)

2. **State Management Fragmentation**
   - Multiple store patterns (Zustand stores, context providers, custom hooks)
   - Some stores are too large and handle multiple concerns
   - Missing clear patterns for async state management

3. **Development Workflow**
   - No component development environment (Storybook)
   - Limited component documentation
   - Inconsistent testing approach

4. **Code Quality Issues**
   - TypeScript strictness could be improved (some `any` types)
   - Missing ESLint rules for consistency
   - Large components that could be broken down

5. **Performance Concerns**
   - Large bundle size (vendor chunks)
   - Some components re-render unnecessarily
   - Missing code splitting in some features

## üõ†Ô∏è Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Design System Standardization

**Goal**: Create a consistent, well-documented design system

**Actions**:

- [ ] Audit all UI components and create a component inventory
- [ ] Standardize component APIs (props, naming conventions)
- [ ] Create a style guide with color palette, typography, spacing
- [ ] Implement CSS-in-JS solution or CSS modules for component styles
- [ ] Remove redundant button variants and consolidate to 3-4 core variants

**Example refactor**:

```typescript
// Before: Multiple button implementations
<Button variant="primary" />
<CircleButton type="primary" />
<NavigationButton active />

// After: Single Button component with consistent API
<Button variant="primary" shape="circle" />
<Button variant="navigation" active />
```

#### 1.2 TypeScript Improvements

**Goal**: Improve type safety across the codebase

**Actions**:

- [ ] Enable stricter TypeScript rules
- [ ] Replace all `any` types with proper types
- [ ] Create shared type definitions for common patterns
- [ ] Add type guards for runtime safety

**Example tsconfig.json updates**:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: State Management (Week 2-3)

#### 2.1 Store Refactoring

**Goal**: Simplify and optimize state management

**Actions**:

- [ ] Split large stores into smaller, focused stores
- [ ] Implement consistent async patterns (React Query for server state)
- [ ] Create store composition patterns
- [ ] Add middleware for debugging and persistence

**Example store split**:

```typescript
// Before: Large UIStore handling multiple concerns
const useUIStore = create((set, get) => ({
  // UI state
  theme: 'light',
  showModal: false,
  // Game state
  gameWinner: null,
  gameEndAt: null,
  // Player state
  selectedPlayer: null,
  // ... 50+ more properties
}));

// After: Focused stores
const useThemeStore = create(...);
const useModalStore = create(...);
const useGameStateStore = create(...);
const usePlayerStore = create(...);
```

#### 2.2 Context Optimization

**Goal**: Reduce unnecessary re-renders

**Actions**:

- [ ] Split large contexts into smaller ones
- [ ] Implement context selectors
- [ ] Use React.memo strategically
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Component Architecture (Week 3-4)

#### 3.1 Component Decomposition

**Goal**: Break down large components into smaller, testable units

**Actions**:

- [ ] Identify components > 200 lines
- [ ] Extract hooks for business logic
- [ ] Create compound components for complex UIs
- [ ] Implement container/presenter pattern

**Example decomposition**:

```typescript
// Before: Large World component (200+ lines)
export const World = () => {
  // 50+ lines of hooks and state
  // Complex render logic
};

// After: Decomposed components
export const World = () => {
  return (
    <WorldProvider>
      <WorldLayout>
        <WorldNavigation />
        <WorldContent />
        <WorldOverlays />
      </WorldLayout>
    </WorldProvider>
  );
};
```

#### 3.2 Performance Optimization

**Goal**: Improve runtime performance

**Actions**:

- [ ] Implement code splitting for features
- [ ] Add React.lazy for heavy components
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with memo and callbacks
- [ ] Profile and fix performance bottlenecks

### Phase 4: Developer Experience (Week 4-5)

#### 4.1 Testing Infrastructure

**Goal**: Establish comprehensive testing patterns

**Actions**:

- [ ] Set up testing utilities for common patterns
- [ ] Create test fixtures and mocks
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical flows
- [ ] Implement visual regression tests

#### 4.2 Documentation

**Goal**: Improve code discoverability and onboarding

**Actions**:

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to public APIs
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Document complex business logic
- [ ] Add inline code examples

     // ... rest of palette
   };
   ```

4. **Extract magic numbers**

   ```typescript
   // Before
   if (health < 20) { ... }

   // After
   const LOW_HEALTH_THRESHOLD = 20;
   if (health < LOW_HEALTH_THRESHOLD) { ... }
   ```

5. **Add loading states**
   ```typescript
   // Add consistent loading patterns
   const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(...);
   if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
   if (error) return <ErrorBoundary error={error} />;
   ```

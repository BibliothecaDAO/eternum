        You have been chosen to lead your people to greatness. You must build your empire, forge alliances, and conquer
        your enemies. Only the strong will survive.

      <h3>Your Realm</h3>
      <p>You have a hex-based realm that you can build on. Each hex can be used to construct buildings.</p>

      <h3>Upgrading to the next Level</h3>
      <p>
        As you grow you need more space. Leveling up your Realm enables you to expand into a greater area of the Realm
        allowing more constructions.

# Current Priorities

1. **Exploration** (HIGH) - Must understand the map before committing
2. **Economy** (HIGH) - Early resource advantage compounds
3. **Combat** (LOW) - No known threats yet
4. **Social** (LOW) - No diplomatic opportunities identified

## Reasoning

Opening phase. Information and economy are the foundation for everything
else. Combat and social priorities will shift once we have more data
about the game state and opponents.

# Early Game Opening

## When To Use

- Game just started (tick 0-100)
- No information about opponent yet
- Need to establish economic foundation

## Build Order

### Phase 1: Workers (ticks 0-30)

1. Build workers continuously until you have a basic economy
2. Assign workers to nearest resource nodes
3. Send one unit to scout

### Phase 2: Scout (ticks 20-50)

1. Scout all adjacent areas
2. Identify enemy base location
3. Note resource node positions
4. Check for early aggression signals

### Phase 3: Expand (ticks 40-80)

1. If scout shows no immediate threat, expand to nearest resource
2. If threat detected, build military first
3. Maintain worker production during expansion

## Transition Points

- **Scout sees enemy military early**: Switch to defending-a-rush skill
- **Map is wide open**: Consider aggressive expansion
- **Enemy also booming**: Safe to continue economic focus

## Common Mistakes

- Building military too early (wastes resources on units that aren't needed yet)
- Not scouting (flying blind leads to bad decisions)
- Expanding without scouting first (expansion could be in danger)

# Defending a Rush

## When To Use

- Enemy military units spotted moving toward your base before tick 80
- You have fewer military units than the attacker
- Your economy is not yet established enough to fight head-on

## Immediate Actions

1. **Stop worker production** - Switch all production to military
2. **Rally defensive units** at chokepoint nearest to your base
3. **Pull workers** to safety behind your military line
4. **Wall off** if possible - use buildings to block paths

## Defensive Positioning

- Hold at the tightest chokepoint between enemy and your base
- Use terrain advantage (high ground, narrow passages)
- Keep ranged units behind melee units
- Don't chase retreating enemies - hold position

## When to Counterattack

- ONLY after you've fully repelled the rush
- Ensure you have at least 1.5x the enemy's remaining force
- Target their economy first (they spent resources on early military)

## Recovery After Rush

- If survived: you're ahead (they wasted resources on early aggression)
- Resume worker production immediately
- Expand cautiously - they may try again
- Maintain higher military count than pre-rush

## Soul Alignment

When this skill is active, temporarily override soul traits:

- Set Aggression to 3/10 (defensive mode)
- Set Paranoia to 8/10 (expect follow-up attacks)
- Set Patience to 8/10 (don't overcommit to counterattack)

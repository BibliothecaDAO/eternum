# Realms: Eternum

Eternum is the foundational game for Realms World - a living digital ecosystem that evolves through player interaction.
It serves as both a game and an open platform.

### Eternum as a Game

A high-stakes strategy game played in competitive seasons where players forge their own unique path to victory. On an
infinite hexagonal world map, players:

- Build resource stockpiles
- Train troops
- Explore the map
- Trade resources
- Form alliances
- Compete for dominance

Access requires a Season Pass minted from Loot Realms NFTs. Players use $LORDS tokens to trade in the game's free market
on Starknet.

### Eternum as a Platform

Eternum provides the core infrastructure for building games and applications. It includes:

- Core functional systems
- Fungible resource framework
- Extensible architecture

### Open World Philosophy

Eternum is built as an Autonomous World with two core principles:

1. Radical Openness

- No gatekeepers or central control
- Anyone can build and contribute
- Open source and extensible

2. Persistence

- Fully onchain game state
- Immutable seasons
- Player-driven evolution

The platform is designed to be forked and extended by the community, serving as the foundation for an expanding
ecosystem of games and applications.

## Eternum Packages Overview

The Eternum ecosystem is composed of several core packages, each serving a specific role in the development and
operation of the game and platform:

### Core (`@bibliothecadao/eternum`)

The foundation of the Eternum SDK, providing essential building blocks for applications on Starknet & Dojo. Includes the
main provider implementation, core data structures, utility functions (such as hex map and resource management), and
specialized managers for game logic. Enables seamless blockchain integration and protocol interaction.

### Provider (`@bibliothecadao/provider`)

A comprehensive, type-safe interface for interacting with Eternum game contracts. Manages all game transactions (army,
battle, trading, guild, structure, resource, and quest operations), contract calls, and event handling. Features a smart
promise queue that batches and optimizes transaction execution for performance and reliability.

### React (`@bibliothecadao/react`)

A collection of shared React hooks and stores designed for Eternum game applications. Provides easy access to game
state, player data, and contract interactions within React components. Simplifies frontend development by offering hooks
for realms, resources, and player-owned data, ensuring smooth integration with the Eternum backend.

### Torii (`@bibliothecadao/torii`)

Enables advanced querying of on-chain Eternum data. Supports both gRPC-based queries (via the torii-client) and direct
SQL queries (via the sql folder), allowing developers to fetch, filter, and aggregate game data efficiently. Ideal for
analytics, dashboards, and any application requiring rich data access.

### Types (`@bibliothecadao/types`)

A centralized collection of type definitions and constants used throughout the Eternum ecosystem. Ensures type safety
and consistency across all packages, covering entities, resources, transactions, and system properties. Essential for
maintaining a robust and reliable codebase.

| Package  | Description                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core     | Foundation for Eternum apps: provider, data structures, utilities, and managers.     |
| Provider | Type-safe interface for all game contract interactions and transaction management.   |
| React    | Shared React hooks and stores for easy frontend integration with Eternum game state. |
| Torii    | Advanced on-chain data querying via gRPC and SQL for analytics and dashboards.       |
| Types    | Centralized type definitions and constants for consistency and type safety.          |

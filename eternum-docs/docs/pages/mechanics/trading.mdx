# Trading System

## Order Book

- Trade resources with other players
- All trades require donkeys for transport
- Resources have weight that affects transport capacity
- Monitor market prices for optimal trading

## Automated Market Maker (AMM)

### Swaps

The AMM enables players to swap resources for $LORDS and vice versa. Exchange rates are influenced by liquidity pools.

### Liquidity Pools

Players can provide liquidity by depositing resources and $LORDS into pools. This earns trading fees proportional to
your share and helps maintain a stable trading environment, increasing overall market efficiency.

## Transport <img src="/resources/249.png" alt="Donkey" width="200" className="float-right" />

Donkeys are essential for all resource transfers. Each donkey can carry up to 100kg, and transport time depends on the
distance to its destination. It's important to consider transport costs in your trade calculations.

## Central Bank <img src="/buildings/bank.png" alt="Bank" width="300" className="float-right" />

The central bank is a neutral structure, located at the center of the map, that controls the AMM and receives a part of
its fees.

Anyone can claim it for himself, but be wary, as it is protected by a significant defensive force.

**Ownership Benefits:**

- Owner collect AMM trading fees, providing a significant source of passive income.
- The bank can be attacked and claimed by other players, making it a strategic target.

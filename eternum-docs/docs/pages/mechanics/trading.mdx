# ü´è Trading System

## Order Book

- Trade resources with other players
- All trades require donkeys for transport
- Resources have weight that affects transport capacity
- Monitor market prices for optimal trading

## Automated Market Maker (AMM)

### Swaps

The AMM enables players to swap resources for $LORDS and vice versa. Exchange rates are influenced by liquidity pools.

### Liquidity Pools

Players can provide liquidity by depositing resources and $LORDS into pools. This earns trading fees proportional to
your share and helps maintain a stable trading environment, increasing overall market efficiency.

## Transport <img src="/resources/249.png" alt="Donkey" width="200" className="float-right" />

Donkeys are essential for all resource transfers. Each donkey can carry up to 100kg, and transport time depends on the
distance to its destination. It's important to consider transport costs in your trade calculations. Ensure your realm
has the necessary resources for transportation.

### Transporting Resources

{/* TODO: Dynamic DONKEY_SPEED */}

To bridge resources, visit the [Empires Bridge](https://empire.realms.world/trade).

- **Sending Resource**s: When you want to send resources (like $LORDS) to another realm, the bridge calculates the
  distance and travel time based on the coordinates of your realm and the central bank. The transport time depends on
  the distance and is calculated based on the donkey's speed of 24 seconds per kilometer.
- **Withdrawing Resources**: To bridge resources out of the game, you must first travel from your realm to the central
  bank. This process is not instant, resources must physically "move" to the bank.

## üè¶ Central Bank <img src="/buildings/bank.png" alt="Bank" width="300" className="float-right" />

The Central Bank is a neutral structure, located at the center of the map, that controls the AMM and receives a part of
its fees. The central bank acts as the hub for all bridging activities. Whether you‚Äôre sending resources to another
realm or withdrawing them, everything must pass through the central bank first.

Anyone can claim it for themselves, but be wary, as it is protected by a significant defensive force.

> When the Bank is being attacked, the AMM will be **locked** until the battle has ended.

**Ownership Benefits:**

- Owner collect AMM trading fees, providing a significant source of passive income.
- The bank can be attacked and claimed by other players, making it a strategic target.

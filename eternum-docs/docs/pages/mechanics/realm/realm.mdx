# Realms

Originally created as "Realms (For Adventurers)", they were the first Loot derivative, comprising 8,000 generative maps
with unique metadata of resources and traits.

## Realm Access

- Each Realm NFT grants entry into Eternum seasons
- Owners become Lords of their onchain kingdoms
- Access to specific resources from the 22 available types

## Realm Levels

As your realm grows, you will need more buildable space to expand. Upgrading your realms from a settlement to an empire
requires various resources. The costs of upgrading your realms are as follows:

<RealmUpgradeCosts
  level={RealmLevels.Settlement}
  description="Settlement - a small settlement with 6 buildable hexes."
/>

<RealmUpgradeCosts level={RealmLevels.City} description="City - a glorious city with 18 buildable hexes." />

<RealmUpgradeCosts level={RealmLevels.Kingdom} description="Kingdom - a kingdom with 36 buildable hexes." />

<RealmUpgradeCosts level={RealmLevels.Empire} description="Empire - a vast empire with 60 buildable hexes." />

## Starting Values

## Settlement Immunity

When first settling a realm, you receive:

    immunity from attacks and from attacking others
  </span>

- Protection from resource raids
- Time to establish basic defenses

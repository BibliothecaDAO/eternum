# Key Concepts

## Time Cycle

Everything in the Eternum revolves around an Eternum Day. Each Eternum Day is 60 minutes long. The hourglass timer
displays the percentage of the day that has passed.

## World Map

The Eternum world can be explored. Search for realms, significant structures and strategise battles. Armies can traverse
through hexes that have already been discovered or venture into unexplored ones. This movement consumes stamina and
depletes food supplies from their realm. Unexplored hexes requires 20 stamina to explore. Explored hexes requires 10
stamina to travel. Stamina is partially replenished each Eternum Day.

## Resource Production

Resources are produced by buildings in a realm. Most resources are consumed by other resources in order to produce.
Maintaining a balanced production is key to sustaining resource production for the realm. If there are not enough
resources or storage, the production will stop but continues to deplete the available input resources until it paused.

## Trading

Trading is the backbone of the economy in Eternum. The Lords Market is a central marketplace where players can buy and
sell resources to each other. Trades are facilitated via donkeys and the cost depends on the weight of the resources
being transported. Donkeys are required for all trades.

## Hyperstructures

Hyperstructures are the key to ruling Eternum. Build and contribute to them and earn valuable Victory Points (VP).
Hyperstructures are built using Ancient Fragments that can only be obtained by defeating the bandits that defend the
mines or by trading. Once a player reaches the required seasons VP they will be able to end the season.

## Tribes

Tribes are player-formed social organizations in Eternum that enable cooperation and coordination. Anyone can join
public tribes.

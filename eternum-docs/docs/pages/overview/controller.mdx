# Cartridge Controller

The Cartridge Controller is a gaming-focused smart contract wallet that makes Web3 gaming accessible and transactionless
via Session Keys. You must have a controller to play Eternum. To find out more about the controller, read their
documentation [here](https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/overview).

## Using the Controller in Eternum

To use Season Passes and **$LORDS**, you will need to transfer them from your ArgentX or Braavos wallet to your
controller.

To use the controller, you can either log in or sign up when starting Eternum. To create a controller, simply input a
username and sign up.

You will then be prompted to set up a Passkey and PIN password. Once this is complete, you will be able to 'Create
Session'. This enables all of the game functions in a transactionless session.

## Transfer Season Pass to Controller

Transfer a season pass to your controller easily [here](https://empire.realms.world/season-passes). Connect your

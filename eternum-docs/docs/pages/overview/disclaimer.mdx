# Disclaimer and Risk Acknowledgment

<Callout type="danger">
  Important Disclaimer – Please Read Carefully <br />
  By participating in Eternum, you fully acknowledge and accept the following terms and conditions.
</Callout>

## Immutable Contracts

Eternum is governed entirely by **immutable** smart contracts. Once deployed, the game’s rules and mechanics **cannot be
altered, updated, or reversed** by the developers, the DAO, or any other party. These smart contracts have not been
**audited**. Players should fully understand the implications of interacting with the system and assess the risks
involved.

## Risk of Loss

All transactions and gameplay actions in Eternum are **final**. There are no mechanisms for refunds, reversals, or
compensation. You acknowledge the **risk of loss of funds** and accept that you bear sole responsibility for any
financial impact incurred.

A season of Eternum concludes when a single player achieves the required
**{formatNumberWithSpaces(HYPERSTRUCTURE_POINTS_FOR_WIN)}** Victory Points and clicks the "End Season" button. At this
point:

- A **48 hour** period begins where you **must** bridge out **all** $LORDS tokens and in-game resources.
- After this period, **all** $LORDS tokens and resources are **permanently** locked within the game.

Players are encouraged to review the documentation for instructions on how to bridge tokens out during the active
gameplay phase.

## No Recourse

By participating in Eternum, you waive all rights to claims or recourse against the developers, the DAO, or any other
associated entities for any losses or disputes arising from your participation in the game.

## Acknowledgment of Terms

Participation in Eternum constitutes your agreement to these terms, as well as all other terms and conditions outlined
in the game’s documentation.

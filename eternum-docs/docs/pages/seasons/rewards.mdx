### Reward Distribution

Rewards are distributed after season end:

- Individual rewards are airdropped directly to the Cartridge Wallet that played the game
- Guild rewards are sent to the tribe leader's Cartridge Wallet, who is responsible for distribution to members

### Winning Conditions

Victory in Eternum is achieved by accumulating **{formatNumberWithSpaces(HYPERSTRUCTURE_POINTS_FOR_WIN)}** points. While
points can only be earned through Hyperstructures, success requires various strategic activities:

- Trading resources to fund Hyperstructure construction
- Raiding realms to acquire resources
- Building and contributing to Hyperstructures

> Any player who accumulates the required number of points can call the END_GAME contract, which disables all further
> game actions. At this point:
>
> - All points are calculated and finalized
> - Any remaining resources or Lords tokens within the game become permanently inaccessible

### Season Rewards

#### Individual Leaderboard

The individual rewards system is based on Victory Points (VP). Any player who earns VP during the season is eligible for
rewards. The payout is directly proportional to the percentage of total VP earned:

- If you earned 5% of all VP during the season, you receive 5% of the individual prize pool
- All VP-earning players receive rewards, regardless of ranking
- Rewards are calculated using: `(Your VP / Total VP) * Prize Pool`

#### Guild Leaderboard

> Season 0 Prize pool:
>
> **300K $Lords**

pool according to the following structure:

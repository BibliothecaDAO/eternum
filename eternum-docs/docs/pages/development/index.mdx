# Stack

- [Contracts](/development/contracts): built using the Dojo framework. This leverages the ECS model, allowing us to
  build quick and ship fast. It revolves around 3 units: Entities, Components (called Models in Dojo) and Systems (more
  about this in the Dojo book).
- [Client](/development/client): our client is built using React with Typescript. We leverage Dojo by using DojoJS, more
  on this later on.
- [Eternum SDK](/development/sdk): our SDK contains most notably the getter and setter of the configuration of Eternum,
  the EternumProvider and most of the constants/types of the world that needed to be transcribed to Typescript.
- [Torii](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/torii): Dojo’s indexer, optimized for that particular framework and well
  integrated into the stack. From our client, we have a gRPC subscription set up through DojoJS and recs to events.
  Events are fired in the contracts as a way for the indexer to know what’s going on in the world. Every time an entity
  is created, updated, or deleted, an event is fired which updated Torii’s record of the world.
- [DojoJS and recs](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo.js?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing-to-dojojs): DojoJS is the SDK
  that allows easy integration of a Dojo app into your client/node backend. Recs are DojoJS's way of exposing the state
  of the world to the client. This is done via queries to the Recs state using a simple query language, which doesn't
  support complex queries yet (e.g. joins, gt, lt, etc...).

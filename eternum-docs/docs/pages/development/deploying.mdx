# Deploying

## Prerequisites

- [Dojo onchain game engine](https://book.dojoengine.org)
- React

## Setup

Install dojo via

`curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash`

Make sure install the same version within the `Scarb.toml` file.

Eternum uses a pnpm workspace and bun for scripts to allow easy npm packages to be created. So you will need pnpm
installed also.

`npm install -g pnpm`

## Easy Method (3 commands)

We have bundled up three scripts to run in three different CLI terminals. Run the scripts in order and leave the window
open.

### Terminal 1 - Client setup

This will set the client up, however you **must** run the other scripts otherwise it will not work

```
sh scripts/client.sh
```

### Terminal 2 - Build the contracts and run the sequencer

```
sh scripts/contracts.sh
```

### Terminal 3 - Migrate the contracts and start the indexer

```
<!-- to set config -->
sh scripts/indexer.sh --setConfig

<!-- to just build and index -->
sh scripts/indexer.sh
```
